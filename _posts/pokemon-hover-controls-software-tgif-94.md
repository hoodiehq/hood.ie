## Open Source

## Design

> Complexity in product design tends to rear its head in two ways 1) the complexity of managing people and opinions. And 2) the complexity of designing the product itself. It’s not always intuitive how to keep your head above water in a sea of features, users and stakeholders. I’ve certainly fallen on my face in the past, so I’d like to share some insights I’ve gleaned about tackling these big design projects. <cite>[Erik Klimczak](https://twitter.com/eklimcz) in [Designing Complex Products](https://blog.truthlabs.com/designing-complex-products-8f9289ab26c9#.ok7ewfgrq)</cite>

## The Web and Development

> Yeah, we would often discuss Jason’s struggle to deliver knowledge. We started playing with the idea of throwing in a swear word. It may seem stupid or trivial, but it’s amazing how much power a hook like that has. It really cuts through and grabs attention. <cite>Brian Buirge, [Profanely Profound: A Conversation with GFDA](http://blog.bench.co/gfda)</cite>

## The Tech World and Culture

> My observation is that they are inspired by a hands-on approach with practical use cases. They like to code with other girls, and they feel uncomfortable in an environment that’s too “geeky” (such as a coding classroom filled with “Star Wars” posters and robots — you get it). They love collaboration and, above all, they are very fast learners when they see what technology can do for them. In this sense, it is like a Montessori approach to teaching coding. <cite>Ebba Blitz, [What my daughters learned at summer coding camp](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/29/12318834/girls-coding-camp-tech-careers-in-the-making)</cite>
