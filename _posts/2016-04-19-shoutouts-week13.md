Gigantic thanks to [Charlotte](https://github.com/Charlotteis), [Jan](https://github.com/janl), [Nick H](https://github.com/HipsterBrown), [Nick C](https://github.com/nickcolley), [Stephan](https://github.com/boennemann), [Markus](https://github.com/coderbyheart), [Cody](https://github.com/codyzu), [Marisa](https://github.com/marisalaneous), and [Sebastian](https://github.com/sebbel) for their continual commitment to reviewing and keeping things ticking over nicely.

[Finn](https://github.com/finnp) has written a useful script to collect all the weekly Shoutouts in a single convenient summary. Finn has also worked hard on migration of the internal architecture, which is awesome. Thanks! 

[Gregor](https://github.com/gr2m) for handling cross-module initialisations, plus a lot of reviews and comments, along with a bunch of other important stuff, ensuring Hoodie stays in tip-top shape 24/7.

Good job all around by [Manit](https://github.com/kazekagegaara), a recent first PR who has kept up the Hoodie momentum with additional commits and reviews. Keep it up!   

[Cecily](https://github.com/skeskali) and [Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) are consistently doing cool stuff with the editorial, especially the TGIF blog posts - well done and keep up the good work!

## That's all for now, watch out for the next instalment of Shoutouts, coming soon!
