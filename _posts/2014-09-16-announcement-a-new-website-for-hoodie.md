You know what it's like with clothes you love, right? They're cozy and make you feel comfortable and safe, and so you wear them any time you can, regardless of the weather and change of seasons. Unfortunately, even the most beautiful clothes tend to get broken from time to time – then you have to add patches or renew seams, and sometimes they also lose their bright colours after some time.

This beloved garment is what Hoodie's website is to us. Being set up initially on only a few days in spring 2013, it has always been a great companion in the past 1.5 years since we launched it. Hundreds of thousands of people have viewed it, to many of them it was the first thing they saw of this project. Over the time, it slightly changed: we added new pages, we changed a bit of its content, but in total, it always stayed the same. Completely aware that it wasn't perfect, it was still reliable and always there for us when we needed it. But we always knew it wouldn't be with us forever.

And now the time has come.

## We're very happy to announce that we'll be launching a completely new Hood.ie website and documentation soon*.

We have been receiving a lot of feedback from many people about the current website. Our community has also grown enormously, and the project itself has moved further. We have been thinking a lot about

* how we talk about Hoodie
* how we can make clear to people what it is, what it does in general, and what it can do for them specifically
* how we can show people easily how they can contribute to Hoodie
* how we're onboarding new community members
* how we can make Hoodie more understandable and more accessible
* how we can depict content that is valuable to people
* how we can show the values, goals and philosophy which mean a lot to us and are deeply embedded in our work on Hoodie
* how we can show our appreciation to the huge number of people who have been and are supporting Hoodie

and much, much more.

The work on this relaunch project has started in January 2014, and since then, many thoughts have gone into this. Parts of our community have then taken on the actual work on the design, technical setup and the content by August. We also found new coding and non-coding contributors who have joined Hoodie because of this project, and we're looking forward to introducing them all to you soon.

In parallel, there was also a team of community members who had started finally setting our documentation up. Our lack of documentation has been a hurting issue for quite some time, but these people helped us make enormous progress. And because of them, we're now also glad to announce that **we will launch the first tranche of the documentation** together with the new website.

And we're ourselves very much looking forward to seeing all of this get together.

The new website aims to show what this is all about: **Hoodie is for you**, those amazing people out there, those of you who have been with us for a long time, those of you who just met us and those of you who haven't heard of us yet. Our daily work on this project is because of and for you. And this is what our new website and documentation will be about.

Please stay tuned. We're looking forward to making this happen.
