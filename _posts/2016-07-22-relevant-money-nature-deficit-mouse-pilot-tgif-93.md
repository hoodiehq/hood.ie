TGIF! ‚Äì¬†Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it‚Äôs Friday, and again it‚Äôs time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, they‚Äôre curated for you by [Jenn](http://twitter.com/jennwrites), enjoy!

## Open Source

> ...the same question came up again and again: why would an open source project need money? It‚Äôs a fair question to ask. After all, so many open source projects have been thriving without money. Not to mention that adding money into a volunteer based community can have a negative effect. <cite>Xavier Damman, [Money and Open Source Communities](https://medium.com/open-collective/money-and-open-source-communities-64b1c2f6aec4#.56z5opqtu)</cite>

[Don‚Äôt Make Me Code](https://twitter.com/dontmakemecode): amazing podcast on developer experience, something at the very core of Hoodie. Recommended for everyone who wants to help make the Hoodie (or other Open Source projects) experience great for developers!

## Design

> In a general sense, the front end developer is positioned in the middle of lots of other jobs. Everybody involved in a web team ends up talking with the front end developers. That makes sense. The front end developers create the actual thing people interact with. Everything comes together with the front end developer. <cite>Chris Coyier, [A Front End Developer is Aware](https://css-tricks.com/front-end-developer-aware/), via CSS-Tricks</cite>

[The Metro Project](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2016/july/the-metro-project-some-train-stations-really-are-beautiful/) certainly presents railway systems as awe-inspiring, focusing on their form rather than simply the function of transportation that they serve. A suggestion perhaps that public transport ordinarily associated with monotony, repetition and the daily grind can in fact be a thing of beauty.

## Science

> Parents have increased concerns for their children‚Äôs safety. They are less willing to let their children play outdoors without direct supervision. As a result, children spend most of their free time in organized sports, music and arts activities. This results in less time for unstructured play than in previous generations. Richard Louv, writer and nature-time advocate, describes this condition as a ‚Äúnature deficit disorder.‚Äù <cite>[Connecting Children With Nature Through Smart Toy Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/connecting-children-with-nature-through-smart-toy-design/), Smashing Magazine</cite>

> Where did all the good jobs go? They didn‚Äôt head to other countries or even down the street. The good jobs I‚Äôm talking about are the ones that our parents were used to. Steady, consistent factory work. The sort of middle class job you could build a life around. Jobs where you do what you‚Äôre told, an honest day‚Äôs work, and get rewarded for it. Those jobs. Where did they go? <cite>Seth Godin, [The computer, the network and the economy](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/07/the-computer-the-network-and-the-economy.html)</cite>
