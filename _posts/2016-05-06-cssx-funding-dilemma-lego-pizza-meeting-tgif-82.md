TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, curated just for you by [Jenn](http://twitter.com/jennwrites). Enjoy!


## Open Source

> There’s a catch. When you release an open source library you implicitly volunteer to be the ongoing maintainer of that library. It’s an unpaid job that imposes real time commitments.

[We asked 15,000 people who they are, and how they’re learning to code](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.4hlet6b56)

## Design

> Accessibility will not force you to make a product that is ugly, boring, or cluttered. It will introduce a set of constraints to incorporate as you consider your design.

>First of all, good hiring managers should not be exerting this pressure because good developers can learn and good managers can encourage them. It’s unrealistic to expect junior developers to know frameworks that solve problems they’ve never experienced. They’ll struggle every step of the way and never really get it.

## The Business

> Women are far more likely to be interrupted in meetings, and their ideas are taken less seriously. It’s so common that some researchers have created a taxonomy to explain everything from “manterrupting” (a man unnecessarily interrupting a woman) to “mansplaining” (a man interrupting a woman to explain something that she actually knows more about than he does) to “bropropriating” (a man taking credit for a woman’s idea).
