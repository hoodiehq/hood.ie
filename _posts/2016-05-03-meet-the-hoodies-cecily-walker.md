Hooray! It is time for us to introduce another one of our contributors in our series, Meet the Hoodies! I had a chance to chat with [Cecily Walker](https://twitter.com/skeskali), editorial team contributor, TGIF leader, and librarian! Let’s see what she had to say:

## 1. What’s your favorite animal?
 
Without a doubt, it has to be the llama. There’s just something about their quizzical, dopey faces and appearance that makes me feel like a kid again. Whenever I see one in real life, I squeal like a gleeful toddler.

## 2. What’s your role / what have you contributed to Hoodie?

I edit the [TGIF blog posts](http://hood.ie/blog/speed-coders-offer-alien-robots-scholarships-tgif-79.html), Hoodie’s weekly summary of reading recommendations. I’d like to work my way up to more technical contributions one day, but for now, I’m happy to be contributing in any way.

## 3. What’s your favorite use of Hoodie in the wild?

I really like [Ubersicht](http://espy.github.io/ubersicht/#hoodiehq). Because we get so many notifications from GitHub and Slack, it’s nice to see all the to-dos and accomplishments in one place. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by notifications, and Ubersicht makes them a lot more manageable.

## 4. What in your opinion makes the Hoodie project unique and interesting?

The thing that’s most interesting to me about Hoodie is their dedication to reducing the barriers to contributing to open source projects. The Hoodies work really hard at making sure people feel welcome, empowered, and valued, and I’ve never experienced this level of support for newcomers in any other project. People work hard at being approachable and available to everyone regardless of your status or longevity with the program, and it’s really a fun group of people to work with and get to know. __This level of openness has inspired me to try to walk a similar path with the projects I manage in my day job.__

## 5. What advice do you have for aspiring Hoodie contributors?

I know it can be tough to put yourself out there as someone who is interested in contributing to an open source project. I’ve been there. Hoodie is different. The only advice I’d have for you is to reach out to us. I doubt you’ll find as welcoming a group anywhere else. Hang out in our [Slack channel](http://hood.ie/chat/), ask questions, and find out where we need help by viewing our GitHub issues. Also check out [charlotteis’](https://twitter.com/Charlotteis) talk on making [Your First Pull Request](https://twitter.com/yourfirstpr/status/698205474144043008), which can help build a deeper understanding of how pull requests and contributing to open source projects really work.
