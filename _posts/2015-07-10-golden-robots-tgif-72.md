> Lately I've been watching more men give talks about diversity. Personally I'm in favour of this, because 1) If women could fix this, we would have by now – making "diversity" a "woman's issue" is a way of perpetuating the status quo. And 2) there is clearly a subset of men who won't listen to women talking about this (or maybe anything), and perhaps they won't listen to men on this topic either but it's worth a try. That being said, I'm seeing some things reoccur and I think they are problematic. <cite>[Pitfalls for men talking about diversity](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/07/08/pitfalls-for-men-talking-about-diversity/)</cite>
