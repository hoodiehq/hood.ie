To be followed by a second, third, fourth one. Curious people that we are, we had to find out who this committer was. His name is [Lewis Cowper][1] (on [Twitter][2]) and he lives in Great Britain. To find out more about him, we asked him for a chat. And this is what happened next:

**Hoodie: Hi Lewis! What are you currently working on?**

Lewis: I do QA for [WANdisco][3], as of the last few months in fact. Prior to that I drove a forklift in a steelyard. *(Note of the editor: I love forklifts! … Sorry for interrupting.)* I&#8217;m studying Computer Science at the Open University too, so I&#8217;ve been trying to work more on learning stuff outside both those spheres. I&#8217;m trying to move toward doing more OSS stuff, because it&#8217;s an easy thing to learn by hacking around with other peoples code and have a play with stuff, and sometimes you might even wind up improving the project. Sometimes I just break things. But sometimes it works fine.

**How come you heard of Hoodie?**

I know [Caolan][4] in real life, we attend a lot of the same usergroups, and we&#8217;ve talked for a while about how I can learn stuff, and he reckons getting stuck in to something helps, so I started looking at starter issues on the highland library that he wrote a bit ago, and then decided it was time to move on to the Hoodie project. I&#8217;d previously not really had the confidence or knowledge to commit code, and the first time I saw [Ubersicht][5] I was a bit put off by how complicated everything looked, then I started looking into certain issues, and thought &#8220;I could actually do that&#8221;, and eventually came round to actually offering pull requests.

**That sounds really good! (Especially in the context that we&#8217;ve been discussing a lot how to get more new committers involved just a few weeks ago &#8211; so, basically, you&#8217;re our first success :) )**

I think the starter issues and Ubersicht, (which I can&#8217;t get over how awesome it is,) really come together to help make it really easy for people who aren&#8217;t used to committing to larger projects to do so.

**You mentioned above that you want to do more OSS stuff. Just have to ask: why?**

Aside from looking at your examples of how Hoodie gets used as to how people do apps without Hoodie, I&#8217;m not knowledgeable enough to really know just how good it is, aside from Caolan&#8217;s talk at the [GB NodeConf][6]. But Ubersicht I can appreciate even without any background knowledge of anything.

As far as OSS goes, I really just want to help change the world. One commit at a time. If that is a bit far fetched, I know that it&#8217;s just people behind OSS stuff, and they can use a hand sometimes. If that OSS project makes it easy for me to commit to it, then all the better. Basically I can learn far faster by playing with actual code, and the OSS community happens to have a large amount of production code available for me to play with. It helps me understand concepts at a far deeper level than just reading a blurb on a website or a page in a textbook, I find.

**And you can see the impact of your work immediately, which may also not be the worst.**

Exactly, plus because it&#8217;s just people at the other end, I can see fixes that I contribute merged within the day usually. Sometimes within the hour.

**For how long have you been coding now?**

I&#8217;ve been actually writing code since September or so? But I haven&#8217;t done anything major in terms of a project, outside of following tutorials, since the start of February. Around September/October I started going to lots of usergroups in Sheffield to try and learn as much as I could, and that was around the time I started learning code. My own stuff, and proper code commits to projects, outwith typo fixes, and following tutorials, or being in a team that did the heavy lifting, for about a month or so. My github profile seems to tell me that. February 9th would be the first commit to my own project where I&#8217;m doing the coding.

**Did you already choose other OSS projects you&#8217;d like to work on?**

I mostly want to work on things that I use or want to use, so there are lots of potential projects there. I&#8217;m also writing a Python API for Sqwiggle just now, because I know a few of the people there too. I mostly want to work on anything people need fixes for, or otherwise want help with. Anything I can learn new things really. And going to meetups and usergroups is how I tend to find projects just now anyway.

**Thanks to Lewis for your time and your work, it was a pleasure to talk to you!**
