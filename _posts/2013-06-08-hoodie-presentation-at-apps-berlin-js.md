The first time Hoodie was presented on by [Alex][1] and [Jan][2] at apps.berlin.js on 28th of February. The video is missing the last 3 minutes of the talk and the Q&A, but you can catch that at the end [under this link][3] (from around [2:41:00][4] on). It&#8217;s a little lower quality, but has all the content.
