## Design

> Access to digital resources is an individual and societal imperative and a fundamental human right <cite>[A (rough) manifesto for accessible user experience](https://medium.com/@accessibleux/rough-manifesto-for-accessible-user-experience-10a3ea34a3d6)</cite>

> Here are my seven golden rules for caring for your [Junior UX Desigenrs]. Keep to these principles and your junior designers will be happy, learn new skills, and grow their confidence. As one senior UX designer recently told me, “Having someone tell me that I was a great role model or a wonderful mentor were some of the best things I’ve had in my career.” <cite>[7 rules of caring for junior UX designers ](http://uxmag.com/articles/the-7-rules-of-caring-for-junior-ux-designers)</cite>

> Unlike a user persona, which characterizes your users’ goals, motivations, and desires, a design persona characterizes how your product should communicate and ultimately build rapport with your users.<cite>[Crafting a design persona](http://alistapart.com/article/crafting-a-design-persona)</cite>

> In Web design, white space, or negative space, makes the difference between an ordered layout that’s easy to comprehend, and a chaotic, cluttered mess.  <cite>[Embracing emptiness in web design](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/02/embracing-emptiness-in-web-design/)</cite>

> It’s inevitable that at some point in your life you will tell someone you’re a graphic designer and they will respond with “so that’s like brochures and stuff right?” — Begrudgingly you will answer “…well, yeah, sorta”. <cite>A designer's [checklist for designing awesome multi-page layouts](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/multi-page-layout/)</cite>

> Communication plays a vital role in design. Whether you design websites, mobile apps, or wearable UIs, your creations have to clearly communicate their intent and purpose. And since text does a lot of the heavy lifting in communicating purpose, you need a solid understanding of typography.<cite>[4 tips on typography in UI design](https://medium.com/@InVisionApp/4-tips-on-typography-in-ui-design-64cc9e61d60)</cite>

> It happens on the web from time to time that powerful technologies come to exist without the benefit of marketing departments or slick packaging. They linger and grow at the peripheries, becoming old-hat to a tiny group while remaining nearly invisible to everyone else. Until someone names them. <cite>[Progressive Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/)</cite>


> As I hear stories about teams using a microservices architecture, I've noticed a common pattern. 1) Almost all the successful microservice stories have started with a monolith that got too big and was broken up. 2) Almost all the cases where I've heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble. <cite>[MonolithFirst](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html)</cite>

> While traditional graphics applications like Adobe Illustrator work well for certain tasks, they fall short when used to create pixel perfect, mathematically-derived graphics. Anyone who’s attempted to create data visualizations with such software might have encountered these limitations. And while JavaScript libraries like D3 have helped out tremendously, certain types of illustrations and icons can still be difficult to create, and tools like Illustrator leave a lot of room for error. <cite>[Building SVG icons with React](http://jxnblk.com/react-icons/)</cite>

> A common need when creating an API is a variadic function, a function that accepts any number of arguments. <cite>[ES6 in depth: rest parameters and defaults](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-rest-parameters-and-defaults/)</cite>

> Apart from being new and shiny, Promises are a great way to clean up your code, reduce dependencies on external libraries, and prepare yourself for async and await in ES7. Developers who use them swear by them, and developers who don’t just don’t know what they’re missing. <cite> [Introduction to ES6 Promises – The Four Functions You Need To Avoid Callback Hell](http://jamesknelson.com/grokking-es6-promises-the-four-functions-you-need-to-avoid-callback-hell/ "Introduction to ES6 Promises &#8211; The Four Functions You Need To Avoid Callback Hell | James K Nelson")</cite>

> More than a decade after we won the battle for web standards, too much code is still crap. So what do you do, if your company is satisfied with this crap?<cite>[No good can come from bad code](http://alistapart.com/column/no-good-can-come-of-bad-code)</cite>

> One evening this fall, my Microsoft Word crashed. I didn’t send my error report, but afterwards I kept wondering about what would have happened if I had. <cite>[A brief history of error reports](http://www.theawl.com/2015/06/the-errors-of-our-ways)</cite>

> For many people, data security is like a morality play: good [people] trying to protect honest citizens from the marauding bad [people]. It turns out, though, that the best way to provide that protection may be for the good [people] to think more like the bad [people]. <cite>[10 things learned about security at velocity](http://java.dzone.com/articles/10-things-i-learned-about-0)</cite>

In ["Engineering a safer world"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/index.php?q=books/engineering-safer-world) Nancy Leveson revisits and updates ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their system safety concept and adaptes them for modern day techniques for system safety engineering.

## The Tech World and Culture

[Keep your Open Source Open!](https://twitter.com/dch__/status/607827305214418945)

> If you ever played The Sims, you’ll remember that each Sim had a social meter, and if the Sim went too long without seeing another Sim, it would get more and more red and they’d get really cranky and exhausted and probably catch on fire. I’m like that, except instead of people time, I get cranky without alone time. Now this isn’t to say that I don’t enjoy meeting new people at conferences, or seeing old Twitter friends in person. But I have to do it in small doses. <cite>[On conferencing while introverted](http://beero.ps/2015/05/31/on-conferencing-while-introverted/)</cite>

> Tiho Bajic started his career at a fortuitous time in the history of tech — having just missed the dot-com crash but before the advent of 'the social network billionaire.' In the calm between the storms, he cut his teeth as a developer at Toronto-based Workbrain, on a 50-person engineering team that he watched grow gradually and thoughtfully into a diverse organization several times that size. <cite>[Fixing engineering's loyalty and longevity problem](http://firstround.com/review/fixing-engineerings-loyalty-and-longevity-problem/)</cite>

The [#GamesSoWhite](http://boingboing.net/2015/06/04/gamessowhite-hashtag-attempts.html) hashtag attempts conversation about race in games, and goes as well as you'd expect.

> I want to say I needed more tomato seeds. My child-brain decided that instead of figuring out a way to earn the in-game currency, I would alter the universe. — I wasn't the most straightforward-thinking kid. <cite>[On “Real Coding,” history, and what it means to be a programmer.](https://gist.github.com/nodebotanist/0b976847f4c68eb389f8)</cite>

> We've been in the New York Times and been invited to conferences and told that we are Important Voices, doing Important Work, we've been on the news at night and in magazines. We are awash in social capital. But none of it translates to real capital. <cite>[All the women I know in video games are tired](http://boingboing.net/2015/05/29/all-the-women-i-know-in-video.html)</cite>

> When told not to worry about something, that isn't actually an option.  Logically I may know that it's not worth worrying about, but that doesn't change my feelings. Embellishing on this point - there is no logic. <cite>[

> The best way to avoid falling into the culture fit trap is to have an honest look at why someone doesn't match your expectations. Did they not match implicit or explicit expectations? If they're implicit, are they really a part of your company culture? If they are, why are they not explicit? <cite>[Why hiring for "culture fit" hurts your culture](http://www.paperplanes.de/2015/6/11/why-hiring-for-culture-fit-hurts-your-culture.html)</cite>

> At 65 years old, Olympic gold medalist, self-affirmed Republican and reality-show star Caitlyn Jenner has opened up about her gender identity. She chose to “reemerge” as her femme self earlier this week on the cover of Vanity Fair, with a request for people to “Call Me Caitlyn.” <cite>[As Caitlyn Jenner Reemerges, So Should Talk of Privilege
