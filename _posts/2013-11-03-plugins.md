We are happy to announce that the latest version of Hoodie sports an extensive plugin system.

Now anyone can write plugins independently or collaboratively, however they want, and extend Hoodie’s functionality.

Team Hoodie believes in modular software. It makes our lives easier while working on Hoodie and fixing bugs and building new features. But if anything, Open Source is about contribution and modular software design makes contribution easy.

[Hoodie Plugins][1] are [npm][2] modules, if you’ve worked with NPM you know how easy and, yes, fun this is. If you haven‘t worked with NPM, we invite you to join the collaborative coding party. NPM is to code publishing what GitHub is to shared version control and we happily embrace both tools.

Hoodie has three major parts:

*   the frontend hoodie.js, which provides the nice and intuitive APIs,
*   the backend workers that do the heavy lifting and
*   Pocket, the admin interface, or “dashboard” for each app.

A Hoodie Plugin can extend any one, two or all three parts, whichever makes sense.

Two of Hoodie’s core features, Accounts and Email, are built as plugins, although they ship by default. We decided to model these as plugins in order to learn what plugin authors need and to make sure that we are Plugin authors ourselves, so we can make the right decisions for the rest of you.

A plugin can do just about anything, whether you want to send uploaded images and videos through [Transloadit][3], or upload videos to YouTube, or post messages to Twitter, or control a [NodeCopter][4] – [anything is possible][5].

If you are eager to work on something cool, [follow the guide][6] (just beware, it is still a bit rough).

Finally, we’d like to thank [NLnet][7] for their financial contribution to Hoodie. The Plugins refactor kept us busy over summer and NLnet made that possible.

If your Open Source-project could benefit from a donation, you should check them out. We have previously [written about our experience with NLnet][8] and we would totally do it again and recommend them highly.

So yay, plugins! We can’t wait to see what you come up with :)
