*Thank [Goeppert-Meyer][1] it’s Friday! Team Hoodie presents your weekend reading list.*

If you&#8217;re looking at EmberJS and CouchDB, you might try v0.7 of [Ember-CouchDB-Kit][2], which will be released for recent updates. <!--more-->

Did you ever feel bad about what you did (or rather did *not* get done) yesterday? Sometimes it helps to [put time in perspective][3] (and the perspective becomes even more interesting when zooming out to one or more years).

After [@RubyConf][4]&#8216;s [programme announcement][5], many critics emerged faulting the lack of diversity in the lineup (2 female speakers in 44 total). The conference makers reacted yesterday:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    There are many ways that we could have done so much more to increase the diversity and inclusivity of our speaker line-up.
  </p>

  </p>
</blockquote>

So if you want to help constructively making this conference a (as [experiences and numbers from JSConf EU 2012][6] show) better one, don&#8217;t hesitate to [contact the organizers][7].

The best book on JavaScript is crowdfunding a second edition. Support [Marijn Haverbeke][8] and make [&#8220;Eloquent JavaScript, V2&#8243;][9] happen.

Aiming to motivate more women to become tech speakers and providing useful help for conference hosts, [Tiffany][10] has created a special website. So even if you never considered speaking at a tech conference or you are a [conference organizer searching for help achieving more diversity][11]: read this. This is awesome: [&#8220;We are all awesome&#8221;][12].

*&#8220;I wanted Dropbox to revise their system and make it less susceptible to snooping by the NSA, but they haven’t.&#8221;* Ben Brooks is saying [&#8220;Goodbye Dropbox&#8221;][13] and explains which alternatives exist and what possible usecases are.

[&#8220;How I quit my job, learned to code and changed the world&#8221;][14]. Bettina Shzu-Juraschek about her experiences after joining RailsGirls.

*&#8220;In the modern information age we all need to have complete trust in the basic infrastructure that we all use.&#8221;* An [&#8220;Open Letter From UK Security Researchers&#8221;][15].

Recently, the US had a debate about &#8220;lads&#8217; mags&#8221; and modesty bags. Hadley Freeman explains why the term of &#8220;empowerment&#8221; is misused in this context and shows [&#8220;&#8230; Some other things I&#8217;d stick in a modesty bag&#8221;][16].

Whether you had the chance to be there or not: want to see how amazing Berlin JavaScript-week was? Here&#8217;s some photo collections for you:

Reject JS, the event with the purple balloons, in pictures by [Giorgos Giannoutsos][17] and [Matti Besser][18].

And, last but not least: we&#8217;re still working on our collection of our favourite talks from last week. In the meantime, why not enjoy the Reject JS-song? (Video from last year).
