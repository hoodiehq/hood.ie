This year, we won&#8217;t mind the end of summer as autumn promises to be amazing beginning with an entire week in Berlin packed with great community events.

We&#8217;re already excited and very much looking forward to an international, diverse group of developers coming to town for serious nerdery, teaching and learning at [Reject.JS][1] (Sept. 12), [CSSConf.eu][2] (Sept. 13), [NodeCopter][3] (Sept. 13) and [up.front][4] and, last but not least, [JSConf EU][5] (Sept. 14, 15).

The latter is brought to you by the organizers [Tiffany Conroy][6], [Holger Blank][7], [Malte Ubl][8] and [Jan Lehnardt][9]. We&#8217;re glad nearly all other members of core Team Hoodie will be able to make it there, too (even including [Sven][10]). So if you want to meet us IRL, ask questions or just hang out: [ping us][11]!

And for already getting into JSConf EU-mood: watch this video. It&#8217;s amazing.
