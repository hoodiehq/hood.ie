**Hoodie goes native mobile! Wooohooo!**

The first version of Hoodie-iOS [has just been released][1]. It connects to the Hoodie backend API and uses the awesome [Couchbase Lite framework][2] for local device storage, which also handles the replication to and from the server.

At the moment, HOOHoodie supports the following Hoodie features:

*   Sign up
*   Sign in
*   Sign out
*   Saving new objects
*   Retrieving all saved objects of the user by type
*   Replication to and from user database on the server

More features are planned and there are still some issues to work on. If you want to jump in and help, you&#8217;ll [find all to dos here][3]. Your help and support are highly appreciated!

This is a milestone in furthering Hoodie&#8217;s development and we&#8217;re very happy and proud of this. And we want to give a big thank you to [Katrin Apel][4], a Berlin-based iOS developer, who initiated and built this. Thanks so much for your amazing work! <3

P.S.: If you are interested in starting an Android version, please get in touch! :)
