Lack of sleep, jetlags, time zones; many new people, exciting conversations, new inspirations: **it&#8217;s travel time again!** The first Hoodies have already packed their <del>Hoodies</del> bags and left their home towns (safe travels to you! <3). And this is where we&#8217;re going in April and May:

**April 8: [up.front][1]**, Germany

Tonight, Lena will give a talk about &#8220;non-coding&#8221; experts in Open Source projects, the relevance of beards and onboarding experiences at Berlin&#8217;s webdesign and frontend developers meetup in Berlin.

**April 10: [JS Conf AU][2]**, Australia

Last weekend, [Alex][3] travelled to Australia. Hopefully, his jetlag will be cured until thursday, when he&#8217;ll give a talk in Melbourne about where we&#8217;re coming from and where we&#8217;re going. Sounds cryptic? Just avoiding spoilers.

**April 24-26: [JS Unconf][4]**, Germany

At JS Unconf, you never know if you&#8217;re gonna be a speaker or not. But we&#8217;ll try &#8211; [Robin Böhm][5], and [Elmar Burke][6], two friends of Hoodie&#8217;s, will probably get the opportunity to give a talk about Hoodie and Angular JS. Keep crossing fingers!

**April 26: [JSConf BR 2014][7]**, Brazil

[Gregor][8] will travel around 7,300km south-west to get to Fortaleza, Brazil, and talk about Offline First at this year&#8217;s JSConf BR.

**May 1, 2: [Web Directions Code 2014][9]**, Australia

As Alex will <del>accidentally</del> still be in Melbourne, Australia, he&#8217;ll also give a talk at this year&#8217;s *Web Directions*.

**May 7: [manc.js][10]**, UK

Caolan and Hoodie&#8217;s dear friend [Lewis][11] are doing a talk on Hoodie and getting People involved in OSS projects at Manchester&#8217;s monthly JavaScript user group. You should come see their talk! You can registere [here][12] :)

**May 10: [codefront.io][13]**, Austria

Two Hoodies one conference: [Ola and Lena][14] will be going to Linz, Austria. Ola will be giving a talk about Hoodie, Lena will talk about the relevance of &#8220;Non-Coders&#8221; in Open Source. <del>And they will both be eating &#8220;<a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/12/linzer-torte/">Linzer Torte</a>&#8221; all night all day.</del>

**May 14: [Open Tech School Learners Meetup][15]**, Germany

How can you get started with Hoodie as a beginner? Ola will show the attendees at Dortmund&#8217;s monthly Learners Meetup how to do it.

**May 19-21: [Beyond Tellerrand][16]**, Germany

&#8220;Say hello to Offline First&#8221;, and say hi to [Ola][17] who&#8217;ll be giving this talk at this year&#8217;s Beyond Tellerrand Conference in Düsseldorf, Germany!

**May 21: [Decentralize Camp][18]**, Germany

Decentralization is a topic near and dear to us. This is why we&#8217;re happy that Alex got invited to talk at Decentralize Camp in Düsseldorf, Germany, about his and our thoughts on it.

**May 21: [CocoaHeads Berlin][19]**, Germany

[Katrin Apel][20], who built [HOOHoodie][21] (Hoodie-iOS), will give an Introduction to [Hood.ie][22] for your iOS app.

**More: coming soon …**

By the way: whenever we&#8217;re *not* travelling, we&#8217;re based in Sheffield ([Caolan][23]), Dortmund ([Ola][24]), Zurich ([Gregor][25]) and Berlin ([Alex][26], [Jan][27], [Sven][28], [Lena][29]) and are also happy to meet you there :)
