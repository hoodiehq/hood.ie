> Open Source is a key part of who we are. Not as members of any given group, company, or country, but as human beings. Dating back to our very early days, the free exchange of ideas and knowledge—from written language to the designs for tools—is central to how we have advanced as a species.

>Up until now I’ve been a big fan of Progressive Web Apps. I understood them to be combining the best of the web (responsiveness, linkability) with the best of native (installable, connectivity independent). Now I see that balance shifting towards the native end of the scale at the expense of the web’s best features. I’d love to see that balance restored with a little less emphasis on the “Apps” and a little more emphasis on the “Web.” Now that would be progressive.

## The Tech World and Culture

>In rural America, broadband internet infrastructure can be overpriced and difficult to access. It's not just an inconvenience — it's an issue of equality. Poor rural communities in America's South are falling behind in the digital age. But one man is trying to change that.

## We <3

>On the day that I am scheduled to see my friend Chelsea for the first time in six years, I wake up at 4:51pm to a shrieking fire alarm in my hotel room. Semi-conscious and disoriented, I leap out of bed and spin around wildly grabbing at all the things I care about – my phone and passport, the precious slip of paper that will allow me entrance to Fort Leavenworth prison, the bag of quarters that Chelsea asked me to bring – ready for an FBI raid disguised as a fire drill. Before I finish putting on shoes, the alarm stops. Slowly the wave of paranoia in my stomach grinds to a halt.
