## Design
  
“This change is a reflection of preferences within our community, as well as an acknowledgement of our position in an increasingly interconnected world. Encouraging free and open source software realigns our policies with our mission. As an academic institution, we believe that in many cases we can achieve greater impact by sharing our work.”

## The Tech World and Culture

“Imagine if instead of asking your realtor for a quiet street, you asked for one where you could hear laughter, birds chirping and music drifting out of car windows. That’s the idea behind Chatty Maps, a new sound mapping project from a Yahoo research lab in Barcelona.”

## The Business  
  
“Woosh. There was the blood rushing in my ears, just like that moment years ago. But I knew to expect it and managed to focus past it. I waited and listened as my heart pounded on.”
<cite>Anna Marie Clifton, [How I negotiated for an additional $15,000 at Yammer](https://medium.com/@TweetAnnaMarie/how-i-negotiated-for-an-additional-15-000-at-yammer-2d3c137623ec#.ks1e82ef3)</cite>
  
“It started out as a simple challenge: could he meet one new coworker each workday for an entire month? One person. Every day. Couldn’t be that hard, right? To make sure it was a real conversation, he gave himself a rule: He couldn’t leave conversations with new people until he learned at least one fact about them. He tracked everything in a spreadsheet, with a person’s name, their department, and that one fact.”
