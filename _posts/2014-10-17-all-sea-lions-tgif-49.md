Our industry has been infected by a dangerous meme, and it’s one that hasn’t been given its proper scrutiny. Like many memes that explode in popularity, “Worse is Better” gave a name to an underlying fragment of culture or philosophy that had been incubating for some time. –

Human interaction has always fascinated me: social awkwardness, communication style, how knowledge is transferred, how relationships are built around trust, story telling and knowledge exchange. What if a machine invoked an emotional response? –

Kathy <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">wrote an article explaining why she was leaving Twitter</a> and it tore me up inside so I began tweeting Wednesday night, October 8th, 2014, about my experiences last year after PyCon when I became the target of a massive, organized harassment campaign planned in the underbelly of 4chan –

The Linux community is dominated by western, white, straight, males in their 30s and 40s these days. I perfectly fit in that pattern, and the rubbish they pour over me is awful. I can only imagine that it is much worse for members of minorities, or people from different cultural backgrounds, in particular ones where losing face is a major issue. –
