> When I started, I had so many questions and fears (like most people). How exactly do I get started? What can I even do? It seems as if everything is going smoothly without my help? Which project should I contribute to? And what if they don’t like me?

> TC-39, the standards body that defines JavaScript, maintains a gigantic suite of tests for the language. The name of that test suite is Test262. When we started extending Test262 to cover brand new language features, we knew we were in for some surprises. Even so, we never could have anticipated the horrors we would uncover.
