At [JavaScript-days Berlin][1], [Hans-Christian Otto][2] gave a workshop about Hoodie (together with [Kore Nordmann][3]) and an amazing [interview to PHPmagazin][4] *(in German)*. He talks about the &#8220;Hoodie-Buzzwords&#8221; (*noBackend*, *Offline First*, *Dreamcode*) and why he thinks Hoodie&#8217;s approach could be &#8220;the next big thing&#8221;.



One short comment on the talk: around Minute 11:30 he&#8217;s talking about the current weak points of Hoodie, mentioning especially localStorage. He&#8217;s totally right with his criticism here, and this is why the synch mechanism in Hoodie will be replaced with PouchDB (which in turn uses IndexedDB (and WebSQL on Apple browsers)) in the midterm.

We&#8217;re really happy this is happening and the word about Hoodie is also spread in Germany. Thanks a lot to Hans-Christian for your effort! <3
