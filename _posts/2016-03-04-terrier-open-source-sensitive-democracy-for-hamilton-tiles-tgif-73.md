## Design

> I’ve been paying close attention to these small breaks in UX that some people seem so happy to write off — the misplaced humor, the snotty error messages, the binary gender selection boxes, the assumptions about sexuality, the inability to select more than one race. What I’ve realized is that the best way to look at them is as a series of microaggressions.

>Lots of people think caring about these microaggressions is a waste of time, too: Stop being so sensitive! There are more important issues in the world! Everyone’s a victim these days!

> Mostly the people who don’t experience them.

> For those who do, they’re exhausting. They stack up over the course of a day, a week at work, a lifetime of being fed the same BS. A million tiny moments where you were reminded that you don’t fit in, or that you’re not “normal,” or that others view your body as fair game. <cite>Sara Wachter-Boettcher, [Too Sensitive](https://medium.com/@sara_ann_marie/too-sensitive-9752a86a8382#.s4yig43qu)</cite>

## The Business

> Most of these people don’t believe in anything except their balance sheet, and they know how to add two and two. On political interests: they are a parallelogram of different and typically conflicting goals, never defined by one goal only: industrial capital, financial capital, governing parties, states, sometimes the labor aristocracy, all interacting under the pressure of — changing — power relations. <cite>[Social Democracy’s Last Rounds](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/wolfgang-streeck-europe-eurozone-austerity-neoliberalism-social-democracy/)</cite>

does a great job to make this first experience stellar.

We can’t thank [Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) enough these days! Not only does she do an amazing
job with our monthly [Hoodie letter](http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=12d36bbe9418ed6a43127cd62&id=664f4ce8cd),
she took on [Hoodie’s Editorial Team](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/), simplifying processes, adding documentation
where we were lacking, creating a bunch of [editorial Starter Issues](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3Aready+author%3Arenrutnnej)

give up for Jan, thanks for your great efforts 👍

No words needed to express our gratitude to [Nathan](https://github.com/nathanstilwell)
for taking on [adding options.interval.connected & options.interval.disconnected to hoodie.connectionStatus](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client-connection-status/issues/24).

## Hoodie Camp Release

As we mentioned in our [Birthday Post](http://hood.ie/blog/happy-birthday-hoodie.html),
[we are getting close](http://gr2m.github.io/milestones) to releasing an all new Hoodie Version!

We call it "Hoodie Camp Release" because it’s still rough around the edges, but
we made sure that it’s a lot of fun to be part of it :) We keep track of [open
issues & questions](https://github.com/gr2m/milestones/issues/88), but here
is a summary:

- [Implement username change](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/issues/79)  
  The new Hoodie Server does not handle a username change correctly. If you like
  [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), you will
  enjoy working on this issue :)
- There is an issue with [disappearing items after login in](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/issues/19)
  as mentioned above. We could use some help with finding out what is causing it :)
- We would like to [unify Hoodie’s test setup](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/issues/457) across all repositories,
  to make it an even nicer experience to contribute code.
- We found a way to [simplify Hoodie’s Account JSON API](https://github.com/hoodiehq/account-json-api/issues/14),
  and we would like to do this before promoting the new Hoodie version

We also have a few open questions and would love to hear your thoughts on them.
Thanks [Mike](https://github.com/mikehedman), [Ransom](https://github.com/ransomw),
[Jan](https://github.com/janl), [Stephan](https://github.com/boennemann), [Nick](https://github.com/nickcolley)
and [Lewis](https://github.com/lewiscowper) for your feedback!
