Underrepresented groups get so few spaces where they are the focus. Spaces where they get to see people like themselves on stage and learn from them. Spaces where people like them are prioritized. Seeing someone from the majority in a position of prominence in that space is demoralizing. It means that yet again the majority is given priority, even in a space that isn’t supposed to be about them. –

As much of us reformed Nice Guys™ learn, relationships aren't a game you win, and they only work when you're willing to accept a person as they are, in all their complex mess, and you're willing to offer yourself up exactly as you are, no matter how broken, and let them make the call. –
