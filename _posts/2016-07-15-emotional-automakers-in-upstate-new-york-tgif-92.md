TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, they’re curated for you by [Jenn](http://twitter.com/jennwrites), enjoy!

## Open Source

> Upstate New York, 1883 is an odd place to start a blog on Open Source Intelligence. It was here that one of intelligence’s most influential figures was born. <cite>Cameron Colquhoun, [A Brief History of Open Source Intelligence](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/articles/2016/07/14/a-brief-history-of-open-source-intelligence/)</cite>

> If you’re stuck, don’t just sit there and stare at a blank screen, but look out into the world for something that sparks your imagination. Keep track of things that make you go “wow” by logging them into a spreadsheet, pinning them to a board on Pinterest or bookmarking them. At times when you feel at a loss you’ll be able to go back to those points of inspiration and get rolling again. <cite>[Simple Design Tips & Tools for Non-Designers](http://justcreative.com/2016/06/22/simple-design-tips-for-non-designers/) from JUST™ Creative</cite>

> When programmers at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory set out to develop the flight software for the Apollo 11 space program in the mid-1960s, the necessary technology did not exist. They had to invent it. <cite>[The code that took America to the moon was just published to GitHub, and it’s like a 1960s time capsule](http://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/), via Quartz</cite>

[WebKit is ES6 100%, but there’s more to the story. Read how the JSC team kept high-performance for new ES6 features](https://webkit.org/blog/6756/es6-feature-complete/).

> To me, this `Mutex` abstraction and this last example in particular show off the real power of promises. By separating business logic from control flow, by treating pending results as values, they enable the creation of generic constructs for solving concurrency problems. They let you write code that concisely describes the concurrent structure of a problem, without having to explicitly specify when each operation should happen. You’re describing the problem constraints, and the abstractions make sure everything is correctly ordered. <cite>James Coglan (the Jimi Hendrix of JavaScript), [Mutexes and JavaScript](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2016/07/12/mutexes-and-javascript/)</cite>

## The Tech World and Culture

[Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/)

> I am a Black woman who will graduate with a computer science degree from Dartmouth College in less than a year. There are thousands of other Black and Latinx who graduate every year with computer science Bachelor degrees. Most of us don’t get hired into the tech industry. So instead of putting in the effort to look for us, Facebook is ignoring the fact that we even exist. <cite>Kaya Thomas, [Invisible Talent](https://medium.com/@kthomas901/invisible-talent-409a085bee9c#.igyun5q88)</cite>

## The Business

> I have an advantageous starting point. After all, I’m a well-off, white, cis, straight woman. It’s easier for me to meet the arbitrary criteria. For this reason, I call myself minimum bar diversity. I am the least diverse person you can hire, but since I’m a woman, I still “count” as diverse. Plus I make you feel comfortable because I can hit that invisible bar. Minimum bar diversity. <cite>Ellen Chisa, [“Minimum Bar” Diversity](https://medium.com/@ellenchisa/minimum-bar-diversity-2b8342428de4#.rm4zsgle1) via Medium</cite>

> My white friends and I rarely discussed race. We were care free children after all. We were much more concerned with bike riding, mischief, and PlayStation. But when we did discuss race, my friends would always reassure me that the casual racism and discrimination I experienced was just the ignorance of few. <cite>Terrance Thomas, [We Were Never Friends, We Just Grew Up Together](https://medium.com/extra-extra/we-were-never-friends-we-just-grew-up-together-82ec7b8e332b#.vyk8j8vf2), via ExtraNewsfeed</cite>

> Emotions are fraught and even if my insights are rationally defensible, they will do no good. I have at least enough social intelligence to recognize that the debates are at least as much about what people are feeling as they are about the intellectual merit of the ideas being expressed. It took a little longer for me to recognize that my urge to participate was born of emotion as well. <cite>Doug Masson, [We are more emotional than we care to admit](http://www.masson.us/blog/we-are-more-emotional-than-we-care-to-admit/)</cite>
