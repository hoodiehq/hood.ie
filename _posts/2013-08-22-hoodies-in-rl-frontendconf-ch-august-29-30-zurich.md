Focussing on frontend and UX technologies, there will be offered a large variety of topics including [workshops][1] (Aug. 28th) and [talks][2] (Aug. 29th, 30th) by great [speakers][3] like [Denise R. Jacobs][4], [Stephen Hay][5], [Dan Rubin][6], [Janina Woods][7] and many more. (By the way, if this is of interest for you: there&#8217;s still some [tickets][8] and [workshop tickets][1] left.)

We&#8217;re glad to announce that two Hoodies will also attend FrontendConf.ch:

[Jan][9] was invited to give the first talk on Friday 30th at 9am about *&#8220;The Responsible Programmer&#8221;*: Given the web as one of the biggest achievements of humanity, web developers are responsible for carrying on this legacy forward and thinking within a larger societal context. He&#8217;ll explore the topics, skills and problems that define a contemporary, responsible programmer.

Jan will attend the conference together with [Gregor][10]. If you want to talk to them about Hoodie and ways to change the world or just hang out: ping them on Twitter ([@janl][11], [@gr2m][10]), they&#8217;re happy to meet you!
