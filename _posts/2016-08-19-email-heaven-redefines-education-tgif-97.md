> TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, they’re curated for you by [Cecily](http://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!


## Open Source

> In a world where there is less Open Source, there’s less opportunity to participate in the construction of the Web in an open, inclusive manner.

<cite>John Maeda, Global Head of Computational Design and Inclusion, Automattic, on [Why Automattic?](https://design.blog/2016/08/08/john-maeda/)</cite>

## Design

> As a visual artist in general I can tell you when I see something that doesn’t work.  And I can tell you when something is being done to death. The current web design trend is incredibly over-saturated.

## The Tech World and Culture

> When workers get hurt and are instantly pushed out for someone new and healthy, it’s easy to miss the number of people nursing chronic pain and injuries as a result of their jobs.

## The Business

> Rather than accepting that a company like Facebook, which knows more about our personal lives than any entity that’s ever existed, is simply “tech”, we should talk about it as an information broker, as an agent of government surveillance, as a media publisher, as a producer of unmanned drones, or in any other specific description that will assign appropriate accountability and context to their actions.
