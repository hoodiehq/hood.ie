> TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, they’re curated for you by [Cecily](http://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!


## Open Source

> When we started the project, we had low self confidence. Even though we have taken classes on different programming languages, when it came to working with it we thought we did not have all the knowledge it took to get the job done. Now we understand that every working experience is a great opportunity to teach ourselves new things everyday.<cite>Tehetena and HyeSoo, [Hoodie is once again participating in the Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://hood.ie/blog/rgsoc-team-rookies-month-1.html)</cite>

Casual, conversational, and enthusiastic tones performed best <cite>Kate Meyer, [The impact of tone of voice on users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-voice-users/)</cite>

## The Web and Development

> It often feels as though there’s an asymmetric level of respect between disciplines due to a belief that design is easy and therefore something everybody can have an opinion on, while development is hard and only for the specially initiated. So while designers are encouraged (sometimes expected) to involve everybody in the design process, they often aren’t afforded the same luxury.<cite>[Developers own their code, so shouldn't designers own the experience?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/developers-own-code-should-designers-own-experience/)</cite>

## The Tech World and Culture
	
> According to 10 high-level former employees, the social network’s long history with abuse has been fraught with inaction and organizational disarray. Taken together, these interviews tell the story of a company that’s been ill-equipped to handle harassment since its beginnings. <cite>Charlie Warzel, [Inside Twitter's 10-year failure to stop harassment](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/a-honeypot-for-assholes-inside-twitters-10-year-failure-to-s?utm_term=.sbVGpOXE#.vykvP38w)</cite>

## The Business

> When we were the Mac company, if we impacted 1% of our customers, it was measured in thousands. Now if we impact 1% of our customers, it’s measured in tens of millions. <cite>Eddy Cue in [Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi open up about learning from Apple's failures](http://www.fastcompany.com/3062596/tim-cooks-apple/eddie-cue-and-craig-federighi-open-up-about-learning-from-apples-failures)</cite>
