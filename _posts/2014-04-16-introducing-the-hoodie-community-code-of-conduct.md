We strongly believe that Hoodie can only be a success if a wide variety of people with very diverse backgrounds come together and make it a reality. To help communicating this, we are announcing the [Hoodie Community Code of Conduct][1].

These are the main reasons, some more general, some more urgent, that led us to write it:

**\# The question where Hoodie is going**
We want Hoodie to grow sustainably and want to ensure it always is a great place for everyone. Thus, we also want to show which ethical core values Hoodie stands for. This is an important item in the long-term goal of seeing Hoodie grow and make it bigger than us, its current core committers.

**\# The Mozilla Controversy**
The things happening at Mozilla&#8217;s in the last weeks have shown again how important it is to communicate your community&#8217;s values and act accordingly.

**\# Thinking about attracting new committers**
It has always been clear for us which values all of us, Hoodie&#8217;s core team, have and stand for. We want to communicate them to make sure that other people who join us (and there have been and will hopefully be more of them) share those values.

**\# Safe Spaces**
Hoodie aims to be a space where people feel safe. This is even more important for less- and / or non-privileged people and people who may be discriminated against. We want to show everyone and especially those people that we welcome them and how we protect them.

**\# Thinking about onboarding experiences**
We&#8217;ve been talking and thinking about onboarding experiences for new committers / contributors / team members a lot from various points of view in the last months. It has become even more clear to us that this experience is crucial. Thus, we want to ensure that people get a very good onboarding experience when they join Hoodie. The code of conduct is not the only thing we think we can do about this, but it is an essential part of it.

This is why we now implemented a code of conduct for Hoodie. Of course, we trust our community and the great people in it and hope that we won&#8217;t need to enforce it. But we will strictly do whenever necessary.

Please [find our code of conduct here][1].

This code of conduct depicts what we as Hoodie&#8217;s initiators and core team and Hoodie as a project stand for â€” to protect you, us and everyone else who will ever join this community.

If you have any questions, Ashe Dryden has written [a fantastic FaQ around Code of Conducts][2]. The focus is on events and conferences, but we believe this equally applies to Open Source projects. If you have any questions, that are not answered in the FaQ, [please get in touch][3].

We <3 you.

Team Hoodie
