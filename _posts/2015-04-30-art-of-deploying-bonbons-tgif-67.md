TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Fr...ahem, Saturday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. They're curated, just for you, by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Jan](http://twitter.com/janl). Enjoy!

##Open Source

If you're using Brackets for coding, have a look at the now released [version 1.3](http://blog.brackets.io/2015/04/27/brackets-1-3-release-is-here/) in which you can configure, whether you want to send anonymous data to the project.

[Mailman 3.0 is out](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-announce/2015-April/000210.html).

[Git 2.4 has some interesting new features](https://github.com/blog/1994-git-2-4-atomic-pushes-push-to-deploy-and-more).

Support for files with variable-length blocks in HDFS and automatic shared, global caching of YARN localized resources are features of the recently released [Hadoop 2.7](http://markmail.org/thread/ytisa4w73ym4ee65).

> There’s a famous quote by beloved author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry that says “Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away.” While this may resonate with some, there’s still an on-going and healthy debate across the wider software development community as to what perfection looks like on an interface.<cite>[When there's nothing left to take away](http://uxmag.com/articles/when-theres-nothing-left-to-take-away)</cite>

##The Web and Development

[Everyone has JavaScript, right?](http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html "Everyone has JavaScript, right?")

> When a developer talks about quality, we often mean code consistency and readability, plus automated testing. A tester means lack of bugs. A designer means a great UI, a user means great experience and exactly the right features and lack of errors or waiting. An analyst means insightful reporting and the right integrations, a system administrator means low CPU usage and consistent uptime and informative logging. Our partners mean well-documented, discoverable APIs and testing tools.<cite>[The Quality Wheel](http://blog.jessitron.com/2015/04/the-quality-wheel.html)</cite>

> Before I start, let me say that I think jQuery has helped tremendously to move the Web forward. It gave developers power to do things that were previously unthinkable, and pushed the browser manufacturers to implement these things natively. [...]However, being able to do these things natively now is not the only reason I’d rather avoid jQuery. Yes, you probably don’t really need it… <cite>[jQuery considered harmful](http://lea.verou.me/2015/04/jquery-considered-harmful/)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

> People who look like me can just kinda do programming for work if we want, or not do it, or switch into it later, or out of it again, or work quietly, or nerd-rant on how Ruby sucks or rocks or whatever, or name-drop monads. And nobody will make remarks about our appearance, about whether we're truly dedicated hackers, or how our behavior might reflect badly on “our kind” of people. That's silent technical privilege. <cite>[Silent Technical Privilege](http://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm "Philip Guo - Silent Technical Privilege")</cite>

> Process is a necessary and crucial part of any organization. Our fear of bad and unnecessary process has led many companies to reject process altogether. But null processes are just a subcategory of bad processes, and they can lead to problems with communication, unspoken expectations, and discrimination.<cite>[The Null Process](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/the-null-process)</cite>

> Coming back from a nice vacation is full of wonder and excitement. You feel refreshed and with any luck you’re gearing to go. Coming back from parental leave was nerve-racking. Oh, I have a new family member and I’m just getting used to that and I need to figure out how to work while sleep deprived. <cite>[My paternity leave wasn’t a vacation](https://medium.com/@davedash/my-paternity-leave-wasn-t-a-vacation-547ee9615d)</cite>

##The Business

> A common question I am asked, “How big should the team be?” My immediate response: Seven plus or minus three. There is a not a lot of hard theory behind this guideline, just common sense.<cite>[Seven Plus or Minus Three](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/seven-plus-or-minus-three/)</cite>

> It is easy to imagine that this was the work of a great many sloppy engineers, who were not as smart as the rest of us. That has never been my experience. Instead I see hard working developers who want to figure out the right thing, the right way. And so it was here. The hands-on worker bees wanted to test and refactor and clean up the code base. They were skeptical about the diagram. They were also loyal and followed their manager. Brilliant software engineers will follow bad plans put forth by people in power.<cite>[The code is just the symptom.](https://medium.com/@rubyghetto/the-code-is-just-the-symptom-c77f43b29320)</cite>
