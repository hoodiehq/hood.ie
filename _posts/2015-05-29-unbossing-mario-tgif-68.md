TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. They're curated, just for you, by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Jan](http://twitter.com/janl). Enjoy!

##Open Source

Team Tessie from the RailsGirls Summer of Code is [going to be working on Hoodie](https://twitter.com/TeamTessie/status/599901238302547968) all summer!

Hoodie and friend CouchDB have both been [mentioned in the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar as examples of Offline First Technology](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques "Technology Radar ThoughtWorks").

[AngularJS 1.4](http://angularjs.blogspot.de/2015/05/angular-140-jaracimrman-existence.html) is out and includes several improvements regarding animation, $http and internationalization.

If you're into IoT and JavaScript, [macchina.io](https://github.com/macchina-io/macchina.io) seems like a nice project to check out.

[Apache Drill](http://drill.apache.org/blog/2015/05/19/the-apache-software-foundation-announces-apache-drill-1.0/) celebrated its first major release, as did [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/).

##Design

> The majority of work we will undertake will be intended for someone else, in another place, under different circumstances. The design profession is about solving problems that are wholly foreign. We must approach our work as skeptics: exploring, questioning, and researching. <cite>[A checklist for design](http://www.hailpixel.com/articles/checklist-for-design)</cite>

> Burnout is a very real challenge that we face as web professionals. The same processes that help us complete projects successfully can also contribute to us falling into a routine and hitting autopilot on our work. <cite>[Rekindling your passion for web design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/22/rekindling-your-passion-for-web-design/)</cite>

> The premise of usability testing is to find and fix usability problems by watching people use your product. The common misbelief is that it’s important to test with people from your target audience to get useful results. The reality is that you can test your site or app with almost anyone if you’re only writing engaging task scenarios for your participants.<cite>[Why you don't need to test with your target audience](https://userbrain.net/blog/you-dont-need-demographics)</cite>

##The Web and Development

> I'd like to explore why promises are so tricky in the first place, and why so many of us – novices and experts alike – get tripped up by them. I'm also going to offer what I consider to be the singular insight, the one weird trick, that makes promises a cinch to understand. And yes, I really do believe they're not so hard after that! <cite>[We have a problem with promises](http://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html)</cite>

> Performance is a decision. We actively choose whether to devote our time and energy to improving it, or to ignore it and leave it up to chance.<cite>[Choosing performance](http://timkadlec.com/2015/05/choosing-performance/)</cite>

> Most people have a pretty good idea of the trust they’re placing in their doctor, while they have almost no idea that every time they install an app, enter some personal data, or share a private thought in a private electronic conversation, they’re trusting a set of software engineers who have very little in the form of ethical guidelines.<cite>[The responsibility of software engineers](http://benlog.com/2015/05/23/the-responsibility-we-have-as-software-engineers/)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

> When Rust was first opened up, all players were given the same default avatar: a bald white man. With the most recent update, Rust’s lead developer, Garry Newman, introduced different avatars of different racial origins into the mix. However, they did so with a twist — unlike typical massively multiplayer online role-playing games, Rust does not allow players to choose the race of their avatar. Instead, they are assigned one at random. [...] The backlash only underscored a disturbing reality: By insisting that race doesn’t or shouldn’t exist online, such attitudes ensure an online status quo in which people of color remain marginalized and invisible. <cite>[The Web is not a post-racial utopia](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/5/the-online-game-that-proves-the-web-is-not-a-post-racial-utopia.html)</cite>

> Pao said she did not think Silicon Valley, a place where it's possible to have all white male meetings all day every day, was a meritocracy. "I think SV aspires to be a true meritocracy … but there is not an even track to success. No. With 6% women in VC, level of funding for women-led startups, it just doesn’t seem that that could possibly be the case." <cite>[Ellen Pao Says Silicon Valley Isn't A Meritocracy. It's Not.](http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/27/just-look-at-the-numbers/)</cite>

> A lesson from last year: just because you can be a leader, just because you own a business, just because you have one good idea, or a string of good ideas, and just because your title has the word "executive" in it — you do not have to enjoy being a boss.[...] It is hard to talk about female leadership now without entering a feminist conversation, without tiptoeing around words like empowerment or equality. <cite>[Unboss](http://www.designformankind.com/2015/05/unboss/)</cite>

> Persist and keep going. Resist giving up due to negative feedback. It will be worth it. <cite>[Persist! Resist!](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jina-bolton/2015-may-28)</cite>

> When strangers surprise me with the “women in tech” conversation, it’s most likely because they’re in a position of privilege that prevents them from understanding that it’s burdensome for someone who lives this experience to talk about it. <cite>[Mean time to “Women in tech”](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/lara-hogan/2015-may-18)</cite>

##The Business

> I only take on projects where it's likely going to be a win-win. Which is why I tell potential clients not to hire me all the time. Sometimes more than once a week. Their reactions vary too: some are mad, some are upset and some totally get it. <cite>[No, you shouldn't hire me - and here is why](https://medium.com/i-dont-know-a-thing/no-you-shouldn-t-hire-me-and-here-s-why-b9ff847a631)</cite>
