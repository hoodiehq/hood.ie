We are giving away **four** travel stipends to [CouchDB Day Hamburg](http://day.couchdb.org "CouchDB Day 2015 in Hamburg") that takes place on February 7th, 2015.

Just like with [the ticket giveaway for JSUnconf EU last year](http://hood.ie/blog/team-hoodie-gives-away-two-tickets-for-jsunconf-eu.html), we are trying to **enable people who could not otherwise attend**. CouchDB Day ticket are free (thanks to their generous sponsors), travel to and accommodation in Hamburg still costs money and that’s where we want to help.

**We are offering four (4) travel stipends at 150€ each** for your travel and stay to Hamburg to attend CouchDB Day 2015.

**To win, please send us an email to [hi@thehoodiefirm.com](mailto:&#x68;&#x69;&#x40;&#x74;&#x68;&#x65;&#x68;&#x6F;&#x6F;&#x64;&#x69;&#x65;&#x66;&#x69;&#x72;&#x6D;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) and answer the following questions**:

- *Who are you?*
- *What do you do?*
- *Why should you win a travel grant?*

We will announce the four winners by Friday, January 23rd.

Looking forward to hearing from you! And, by the way: going to CouchDB Day is also your chance to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/janl">Jan</a> who will also attend :)
