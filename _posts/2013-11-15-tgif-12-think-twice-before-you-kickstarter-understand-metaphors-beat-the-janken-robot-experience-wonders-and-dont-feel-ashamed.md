<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>&#8212; Help where it&#8217;s needed urgently<strong> &#8212;</strong></strong>
</p>

Typhoon Haiyan killed over 10,000 people in Philippines. Here&#8217;s a list of organizations that help, their contact details and information on donations: [How to help survivors][1].

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>&#8212; Think about software, the internet and culture <strong> &#8212;</strong></strong>
</p>

*&#8220;Make the valuable things easy.&#8221;* A detailed analysis by [Sarah Mei][3], [why you should never use MongoDB][4]

*&#8220;My belief is that there hasn’t been enough discussion around how we design mediums, and in turn, protocols that get us closer to a deeper, more real-world dialogue between people. Perhaps this is a self-fulfilling effect of us relying on web media for this discussion in the first place.&#8221;* – What we lose in a stream-based culture: [How to use the Internet][5].

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>&#8212; Experience a world of wonders &#8212;</strong>
</p>

&#8220;In the age of iPads and Netflix, we don’t want our kids to lose their sense of wonder and imagination.&#8221; &#8211;  A month-long imagination invasion: [Welcome to Dinovember][6]

  <strong>&#8212; Understand metaphors, synchronization and the world around you better<strong> &#8212;</strong></strong>
</p>

See &#8220;the glass ceiling&#8221; everyone is talking about [illustrated in one &#8220;meet the staff&#8221;-page][8].

[<img class="alignnone" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/51f718aa5788770da08e805d1806c118/tumblr_msgzbvzaZm1shrov7o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="599" />][9]
*&#8220;And what this complacent literature purrs into their ears is that creativity is their property, their competitive advantage, their class virtue. Creativity is what they bring to the national economic effort, these books reassure them — and it’s also the benevolent doctrine under which they rightly rule the world.&#8221;* – [TED talks are lying to you][10].

From hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software and different types of architectures in one study of synchronization to date: [Everything you always wanted to know about synchronization but were afraid to ask][11].

<p style="text-align: center;">

Use proper language when coding: *&#8220;opinionated — I don’t believe that your use case exists.&#8221;* – The [Devil&#8217;s Dictionary of Programming][13]

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>&#8212; Technology vs. humans<strong> &#8212;</strong></strong>
</p>

Quite unfair: this janken *(rock-paper-scissors)-*robot system&#8217;s sensors recognize the human hand, its position and shape with a high-speed vision. And it always wins. Read more about this project [here][18].

  <strong>&#8212; Think twice before you kickstarter (or get VC)<strong> &#8212;</strong></strong>
</p>

*&#8220;Open source has been such an incredible force for quality and community exactly because it&#8217;s not been defined in market terms. In market terms, most open source projects should never have had a chance.&#8221;* – [The perils of mixing open source and money][20]

*&#8220;If you’re an engineer readying a product launch I urge you to focus on creating a sustainable business, instead of buying into the belief that acquisition paydays and venture capital is the best way to operate.&#8221;* – [The Startup Lie][21], depicted by a comparison of Everpix and Snapchat.

</p>

During a bout of depression, a young lady by wrote a desperate letter to Stephen Fry. This is his reply to her: [It will be sunny one day][28].

*&#8220;**Technology promises to let us do anything from anywhere with anyone. But it also drains us as we try to do everything everywhere. &#8230; We may be free to work from anywhere, but we are also prone to being lonely everywhere. In a surprising twist, relentless connection leads to a new solitude.&#8221;* *[Alone together][29]* by Sherry Turkle is an exploration of our lives on the digital terrain.

This video is a short movie inspired by this book, explaining *The Innovation of Loneliness*:



<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>&#8212; Give proper answers &#8212;</strong>
</p>

*&#8220;Equality is not a concept. It&#8217;s not something we should be striving for. It&#8217;s a necessity. Equality is like gravity: we need it to stand on this earth.&#8221;* – Joss Whedon, director of &#8220;The Avengers&#8221;, has a history of writing strong women characters. In this speech, he talkes about the tedious and vapid question journalists never stop asking him. This is what he replied ([source][30]):
