The majority of new features flop. You just don’t notice it happening. And that’s the point. ‘New improvements’ sit unappreciated, unused, and are eventually cast aside. Welcome to software. Improvement is hard. –

## The Tech World and Culture

Feminist frequency's second of part of the "Tropes vs Women" series addresses the topic of <a href="http://youtu.be/5i_RPr9DwMA">woman as background decoration</a> in video games. <em>"The Women as Background Decoration trope which is the subset of largely insignificant non-playable female characters whose sexuality or victimhood is exploited as a way to infuse edgy, gritty or racy flavoring into game worlds."</em>

Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian prove points a certain gamer-type refuses to hear. – <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/the-death-of-the-gamers-and-the-women-who-killed-them/">The death of the “gamers” and the women who “killed” them</a>

Not only women drop out of tech. A community is only as strong as its weakest link and behind every user name, there is a person. Please remember that <a href="https://sethvargo.com/leaving-chef/"> so that things like this don't happen</a> and everyone can feel safe.
