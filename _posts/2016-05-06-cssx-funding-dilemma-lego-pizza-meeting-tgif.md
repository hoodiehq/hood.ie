TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, curated just for you by [Jenn](http://twitter.com/jennwrites). Enjoy!


## Open Source

> There’s a catch. When you release an open source library you implicitly volunteer to be the ongoing maintainer of that library. It’s an unpaid job that imposes real time commitments.

<cite>Jesse Wilson, [The Open Source Maintainer’s Dilemma](https://publicobject.com/2016/05/03/the-open-source-maintainers-dilemma/)

[We asked 15,000 people who they are, and how they’re learning to code](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.4hlet6b56)

We recommed the last two episodes of Hanselminutes: [Funding Open Source with Nadia Eghbal](http://www.hanselminutes.com/525/funding-open-source-with-nadia-eghbal) and [Investing in Underrepresented Tech Founders with Arlan Hamilton](http://www.hanselminutes.com/524/investing-in-underrepresented-tech-founders-with-arlan-hamilton)

## Design

> Accessibility will not force you to make a product that is ugly, boring, or cluttered. It will introduce a set of constraints to incorporate as you consider your design.

<cite> Jesse Hausler, [7 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about Accessibility](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b#.nfa2t77mx)</cite>

>First of all, good hiring managers should not be exerting this pressure because good developers can learn and good managers can encourage them. It’s unrealistic to expect junior developers to know frameworks that solve problems they’ve never experienced. They’ll struggle every step of the way and never really get it.

> What I actually want is for everyone creating content on the web to create that content in a clean way that will serve them long into the future. Markdown, I feel, highly encourages that.

## The Business

> Women are far more likely to be interrupted in meetings, and their ideas are taken less seriously. It’s so common that some researchers have created a taxonomy to explain everything from “manterrupting” (a man unnecessarily interrupting a woman) to “mansplaining” (a man interrupting a woman to explain something that she actually knows more about than he does) to “bropropriating” (a man taking credit for a woman’s idea).
