The very beginning of Hoodie was about 18 months ago. Since then, many things have changed, and even more have since it&#8217;s been officially presented for the first time [half a year ago][1]. So it was good to take some people, some time, and a room with a view: a house in Brandenburg, one of the least populated German regions. It was a very good place for a Hoodie-week:

&#8211; for changing habits and perspectives

&#8211; for thinking about how Hoodie can be developed further, where its way could lead.

&#8211; For finding out which supporters, contributors, cute animals,

&#8211; which tools and vehicles,

&#8211; which technical components

&#8211; and which approaches may be the best for making Hoodie succeed.

The great aim behind Hoodie is to focus on people. Caring for them, encouraging, enabling them and giving them the tools they need to build their own dreams and projects and make good ideas come alive is one of the major purposes.

This also means hiding away its complex technical background and making Hoodie like a beautiful, wide living room that people can use for their purpose, a room where they can stay and relax and do the things they really like and love.

Hoodie is and will always be an Open Source Project. And just like playing badminton all alone is not really funny,

also Hoodie will always be a community project where it won&#8217;t be about having one person or small group making decisions for everyone, but many people who take part in and benefit from it.

Hoodie shall (and hopefully will) grow through the knowledge, love, time and effort many people with various backgrounds put into it — attracting more people to join the community and keeping the passion for Hoodie burning.

Now, there are a lot of things to do.

But we&#8217;re highly motivated.

The prospects are great.

And Hoodie is fun.

So let&#8217;s get it started! We&#8217;d be glad if you [join us][2].

And we&#8217;re sure: still the best is yet to come.
