We’ve also got a big shoutout for [Austin J. Reilly](https://github.com/austinjreilly): [first PR](hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account#93) and [first starter issue created](hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account#122), which was done by [Manit](https://github.com/kazekagegaara) as a first PR to Hoodie. Great stuff!

Thanks to [Christoph](https://github.com/christophwitzko) for continuous deployment and Docker image for [Tracker app](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker) and our [Camp tutorial.](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-camp-tutorial)

[Patricia](https://twitter.com/patggs) hosted Offline Web Apps as part of a Hoodie workshop at [Hacking Health Camp.](http://hackinghealth.ca/event/hacking-health-camp/) Last Sunday, [Gem](https://twitter.com/gembarrett), [Nick](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) and [Gregor](https://twitter.com/gr2m) did a [Meet the Hoodies](https://ti.to/hoodie/dc-meet-the-hoodies) event in Washington, D.C.

[Jay](https://github.com/JayWIlsonJr) started his [first PR](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/pull/129) during the D.C. event and found a bug that we had missed until now. [Ola](https://github.com/Oladele) did the same and even [fixed the issue](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/pull/128) while at it.

[Alex](https://twitter.com/espylaub) contributed various text corrections and small improvements to [Camp Tutorial.](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-camp-tutorial/pull/5)

[Finn](https://github.com/finnp) was really rocking it with the [internal architecture migration](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/issues/458).

[Julia](https://github.com/jsimplicio) continued working on our Tracker App and got several pull requests closed in the past week.

[Ransom](https://github.com/ransomw) implemented the <strong>accountAdmin.sessions.add(options)</strong> API, which will be great for debugging your apps.

[Cecily](https://github.com/skeskali) and [Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) brought us the past TGIF posts :)

[Sean](https://github.com/seanjohnite) found out that Hoodie’s connectionStatus API does not yet have 100% coverage, went ahead and fixed it. So much <3 <3 <3
