*Thank [Glob][1] it&#8217;s Friday! Team Hoodie presents your weekend reading list.*

You can use Bitcoin to help the San Francisco homeless stay warm this winter. [How this works][2] and some information on the [background of this cooperation][3].

Want to hire a new Frontend-Dev and interview them? Here&#8217;s [a bunch of questions you can ask them][4], available in 17 languages. <!--more-->

It&#8217;s [time to tame the NSA behemoth trampling our rights][5].

[FlowCon][6] got 40% female speakers &#8211; and this is their 3-steps-how-to: [how to create a more diverse Tech Conference][7].

30 developers, designers and other nerds spending 3 days together on a boat &#8211; that&#8217;s [Nerdboat][8]. And here&#8217;s some [pictures from their journey][9], taken by Mike Adolphs.

&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if someone built a federated, interoperable, open source, and super hackable &#8216;Skype killer&#8217; built on WebRTC and XMPP and released it at [RealtimeConf][13]?&#8221; – [YES!][14]

Grand Theft Auto V is out now. Carolyn Petit, a professional games reviewer, played and [reviewed][15] it, she&#8217;s one among other reviewers criticizing misogynistic aspects in the game, and she&#8217;s been confronted with lots of harassment for doing so. Here&#8217;s a reaction by one who won&#8217;t buy this game [and explains why][16], and another one explaining why the reactions on Petit&#8217;s review were inacceptable: [&#8220;You are not getting it&#8221;][17].

30 years ago, Richard Stallman [announced][18] that he started working on GNU (original post [here][19]):

[<img class="alignnone" src="/dist1/blog/2013/09/gnu.png" alt="" width="512" height="362" />][18]
*&#8220;We may be a technology industry, but we’re still comprised of people, and people deserve our respect, first and foremost.&#8221;* – A recommendable talk about: [&#8220;Schooled in Feminism &#8211; an Ally&#8217;s perspective&#8221;][20].

And here&#8217;s the weekly edition of what Hoodie worked on last week: [Hoodie weekly #11][21].

Science? A capella? Based on a song by Queen? Yes, please: [Bohemian Gravity][22]!



*Enjoy your weekend!*
