It all started under the beautiful palm trees of Lanzarote during the second Hoodie [Offsite](/blog/here-comes-the-sun-here-comes-the-hoodies-hoodie-offsite-2.html).

And then we were off to the races: ideas turned into concepts, Notepads became longer and longer, Hoodie's [Community](/Community) grew, while time passed — we continued our work Hoodie's [core features](/intro), spoke at [conferences](/events), and launched [applications](/initiatives#tools) to manage our work on Hoodie.

**Endless hours of work**, many [thoughts](/blog/announcement-a-new-website-for-hoodie.html) and feedback rounds, long documents with ideas, structures, notes and content, a new repository, lots and lots of coding, and finally a little 'git push --force' *(don't try this at home!)* later, …

## Today is a big day for us

We're launching [our very new Hood.ie Website](/).

![Hood.ie Website Relaunch](/blog/images/201411/hoodie-screenshot-relaunch.png)

## What we worked on for you

More content about Hoodie. More explanations for people who don't know Hoodie yet, more of what Hoodie is [about](/about), more about the [initiatives](/initiatives) related with it, far more ways for everyone to [contribute](/contribute), and finally more about its [people](/community).

Now is the time for us to say

## Thank you

**Thank you to everyone who worked on this**, the people who spent endless hours thinking, designing, coding, writing, drawing, giving us feedback and supporting us with hugs and GIFs.

Our special, big thank you goes to:

- [Ola Gasidlo](/community#ola-gasidlo) and [Kevin Lorenz](/community#kevin-lorenz) – without you two, your endless patience, the many nights of coding and your overall incredibly amazing work, all of this wouldn't have been possible at all. Thanks so much for everything.
- [Alex Feyerke](/community#alex-feyerke) for your invaluable help with the initial design, our new [Events page](/events), the lovely Hoodie Logo animation and so many more.
- [Carolina Buzio](/community#carolina-buzio) for the wonderful collaboration, the best email threads of all times, and your superb work on the [Hoodie Animals](/animals) (see more of the results in the next weeks).
- [Jens Nikolaus](http://twitter.com/jensnikolaus) and [Max Fellmuth](http://twitter.com/maxfell) for your great help with the initial design ideas and setup.
- [Nick Hehr](http://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) for the Jekyll support when it was urgently needed.
- Our old website, that was thrown together by [Alex](/community#alex-feyerke) in a pinch and served us very well until now. Farewell, old friend!
- … and finally to [Lena Reinhard](/community#lena-reinhard) who wrote all content for all pages, took all photos and is responsible for the website relaunch project management.

Thanks to all of you! It was and is a pleasure working with you, and we hope you stay with us and Hoodie.

## That's it

No, it isn't. There's more to come in the next weeks.

Stay tuned & stay awesome, y'all.

*Yours truly,*

**The Hoodie Community**
