[Jan][1] from Hoodie Team [gave a looooooong, long talk ][2]to Max Winde and Robb Böhnke from nerds.fm. Main and most interesting topics were, besides cheesecakes, Hoodie, nerdy beards, cool email-adresses, [couchdb][3], [node.js][4], [npm][5], [asm.js][6], [mustache.js][7] and many, many more. So if you got about three hours of spare time (Hoodie part starts on 01:50) and understand German, which the interview is in: enjoy!
