Math is too beautiful, too powerful, and too important to be reduced to mere mechanical calculation the way most of us experience it in school. That is not what math is really about. What matters in math, and what gives it its beauty, is reasoning and connections between ideas. –

For developers to live up to them, they need to understand that optimal app performance hinges on how well data is managed on the back end. If app makers need to think about how they can apply intelligent data distribution to make apps more lightweight, they can ensure that the data traveling across the network isn’t redundant or out-of-date. –

Perhaps the biggest challenge we face as individuals at work, and as leaders, is attention management.  This means being thoughtful and disciplined about how we split our time between different activities, and also about how we encourage others to focus on the right things. How? –

Empathy is a far undervalued technical asset. Too often, the knee-jerk reaction to hiring a developer is to think purely of code output, as though they are cogs churning out predictable quality product in a silo. The most successful developers I’ve ever worked for, with, and hired were those who actually cared about the people who were using their products on an emotional level. –

In this paper, I hope to explore the common and complicated dichotomy of the "good man": the man who, despite witnessing or hearing about wrongdoings remains passive; the man who does not participate or act in the crime, but does not take a stand against what he knows to be wrong, either on the fraternity or administrative level. –

How much sleep we prefer to get is highly subjective -- but how much sleep we need is a bit more concrete. –
