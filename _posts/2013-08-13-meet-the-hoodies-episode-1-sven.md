Many Hollywood movies spend 90 minutes telling the story of one fateful encounter that changed everything for all parties concerned. Relating the moment when Sven met Hoodie doesn’t take a whole movie but this one tweet:

The moment when Hoodie met Sven occured three months later: someone took a look at GitHub and recognized all those new commits made by only one person that none of us has ever met. And everyone wondered: **who is this guy?**

Trying hard to find this out, we confronted him with a bunch of intricate questions. The result is the following portrait which is being served with some green tea, his preferred drink. We&#8217;re very happy to introduce Sven to you &#8211; <movie-voice> an encounter that is going to change your life forever </movie-voice>.

Interviewer: &#8220;Before getting started, we need some mood in here. What music would you suggest listening to now?&#8221;

Sven: &#8220;*I like a lot of Garage Rock stuff that’s coming from a across the pond, they’ve also made some really good House music in the late 80’s. But having said that, tea might not be the right drink. *

*Whisky, please!&#8221;*

Sven, according to people who know him well, is most likely similar to an owl &#8211; the quiet, yet &#8220;wise&#8221; thing that sits in the corner, rambling. Born in Munich, he always wanted to become a scientist spending all his time in a lab. What’s still left of his love for science is his greatest hero, particle physicist [Brian Cox][1], *&#8220;the Chuck Norris of Science&#8221;*. In 1999, Sven soon gave up the dream of his science-career as he got his hands on a PC. Quickly hooked, he started playing around with things like Mandrake Linux and started working as a systems administrator in networking. Then he made two milestone-like decisions: he moved to London and picked up web development, and looking back on that now, he&#8217;s still glad he made both of them.

He likes collaboration with smart, open-minded people who are down-to-earth and share the same interests. Perceiving that attitude, he’s managed to contribute to some fairly large and / or well-recognised projects in the Open Source-community like [nano][2], [node-formidable][3] and [bower][4]. Besides that, what makes him proud?

*&#8220;Being part of the Open Source-community.&#8221;*

**More things that make him really happy are his bike which he mostly uses for cycling to and from work, <span style="font-family: 'courier new';"> monospaced fonts </span> and his great old Pentax cam (which he should use more often, as he says). And he loves bouldering, improving his skills and relaxing far away from technology. Even further away from technology and one of his wishes for his future would be living somewhere remote, surrounded by mountains, climbing all day long.

Regarding future, we also talk about the further development of the internet. As current trends let expect, considering it being filtered and controlled by corporations and governments, one may be afraid to see it getting further and further away from being free, open and available for everyone.

*&#8220;So it’s up to us as people to &#8216;make&#8217; the web do something about this.&#8221;*

This is one of the most important reasons Sven&#8217;s spending so much time on contributing to Hoodie. Another one: before discovering it, building API- / Web Apps was quite tedious for him as it usually meant always starting from zero. As Hoodie *“cuts away all the boring stuff that is not unique to my app ideas, it lets me focus on the core ideas, values and the fun.&#8221;* So, what does he think about Hoodie&#8217;s future?* *

***&#8220;I think Hoodie has lots of potential to really be a game changer. Ideally, I would like to see it where jQuery is right now. In the sense that people might ask &#8216;how did I do this stuff before Hoodie was around?&#8217;**&#8230; *

(he silences, reconsiders)

*Just write &#8216;World Domination&#8217;. That’s perfect.&#8221;*

&#8212;

**Sven&#8217;s recommendations:
Places to be**
*The river Isar in Munich and the English Garden.*

**Food to taste**
*For Burgers, check Meat Market and Tommies Burger in London.*

**Whisky to savour**
[This one][5].

**People to follow**

*   *[@janl][6]  &#8211; for things Open Source-related*
*   *[@maxogden][7] &#8211; for things cat-related*

**Blogs & Websites to love**

*   [Photobookstore][8]
*   [Longreads][9]
*   [Zach Holman][10]

Find Sven on [Twitter][11], [GitHub][12] or his [Website][13].

P.S.: If you’re searching for him &#8211; he might currently be making &#8220;Urlaub in Polen&#8221;:
