Hello all! It is time for another edition of Meet the Hoodies! I had a little time to sit and chat with our very own Julia Simplicio ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlsmp), [GitHub](https://github.com/jsimplicio)). Let’s see what she had to say:

## 1. What’s your favorite animal?

I like cats. I have pet cats and they’re my favorite.

## 2. What’s your role / what have you contributed to Hoodie?

I’m a frontend designer and I contribute to Hoodie with user experience design and frontend development.

I currently am focusing on a career in product design and like to experience all aspects from the field including researching and prototyping. I plan to keep helping Hoodie with UX and more.

My latest contribution was the Tracker app, which is a simple example app we built with Hoodie. Our goal was to guide new people through Hoodie with an app that showcases some of the major things you can do with it.

## 3. What’s your favorite use of Hoodie in the wild?

Really like how Ubersicht looks. I think it visually looks good and could even foresee better things being built on top of it. Or some things could change, but for now I like how you can see a big number of new and closed issues in the past 24 hours. It would be cool if you could see that number change when you filter for different things.

## 4. What in your opinion makes the Hoodie project unique and interesting?

I really admire the people I collaborate with on Hoodie. There are people from so many different countries and professional backgrounds. I learn all the time from the work my teammates are putting out in the tech field, not with just code, but writing and design too.

## 5. What advice do you have for aspiring Hoodie contributors?

You can see our product and related projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/hoodiehq). Hop on a project you find interesting and find any issues you’d like to tackle or even make your own issues. __We are very happy about new contributors and want to make the experience as welcoming as possible for them.__ We’re currently working on facilitating the Hoodie experience for new and existing contributors and maintainers.
