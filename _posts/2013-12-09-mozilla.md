Team Hoodie is proud to announce that [Mozilla][1] is supporting Hoodie with a $25,000 donation. Mozilla has interest in Hoodie with their [Appmaker][2] initiative. The donation will ensure that Hoodie development will commence faster and some early goals are support for Persona authentication in Hoodie, as well as a Docker-based “Hoodie as a Service” setup. In the spirit of both Mozilla and Hoodie, all this work will be available as Open Source software.

We couldn’t be more happy about this. Mozilla are a huge inspiration for Hoodie the software and us individually and it is a great privilege to work with such a great team and receive their support. Oh, and by the way, the whole [Offline First][3] initiative and [blog post][4] came out of the Appmaker team inviting Alex and Jan to [Mozfest][5], so yeah, this is going to be great!
