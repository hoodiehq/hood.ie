If you’re new to Hoodie, you might not yet be familiar with our animal friends. These animals, like [Low-Profile Dog](http://hood.ie/animals/#low-profile-dog) (or LPD, as some of us like to call him), the [Docs Chicken](http://hood.ie/animals/#docs-chicken) and the [Blog Bear](http://hood.ie/animals/#blog-bear) all play a huge part in making the community fun and welcoming. These friends (plus a few more to be announced) were created by the very talented [Carolina Buzio](https://twitter.com/carolinabuzio).

Please join us in welcoming our newest animal mascot to the Hoodieverse, captured perfectly by first time editorial contributor [Annabeth Carroll](https://github.com/annaboodle).

# Welcome our latest animal friend: Development Beaver

With barely a ripple, a beaver surfaced at the lake’s edge. She glanced around, filled with pride: this carefully-maintained lake was her creation, her beloved home. 

Making her way up the shore, she took measured steps along the tightly packed sand. She rummaged under a nearby rock for a moment before emerging with a trusty red toolbox. With a practiced tap of her claws, the box sprang open. Inside, a treasure trove of neatly arranged tools lay beside a crisply folded hoodie. 

After a quick shake to dry her fur and a crisp zzzzzip into the hoodie, she tapped her tail in excitement: it was time to work. Tightly clutching a sharpened stick in her dainty paws, she began to sketch quickly in the sand. Diagrams, project ideas, problems she still needed to fix...

As we approached, she sat back on her haunches, absentmindedly sharpening the drawing stick with her claws. Glancing up, she caught sight of us, flashed a toothy grin, and raised a paw in welcome. We waved back, greeting our new friend and builder extraordinaire, the [Development Beaver](http://hood.ie/animals/#dev-beaver).
