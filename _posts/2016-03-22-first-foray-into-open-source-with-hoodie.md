## Making my first GitHub pull request was amazing! 

I felt that powerful surge of joy when my PR got accepted and merged. That’s right, I’ve joined my first Open Source project - Hoodie! 

There are so many benefits to participating in Open Source. Firstly, the experience gives the newbie opportunity to interact with other developers and contributors of various stripes, using tools like GitHub and Slack. Working on tasks in a community reflects many important aspects of junior developer roles. 

Secondly, there’s the opportunity to become fluent in using Git and GitHub. These two can be tricky, yet remain an essential part of the developer’s workflow. As such, learning to handle them is unavoidable. Working on Open Source shows potential employers that you’ve already mastered these tools. 

Finally, working on Open Source lets you contribute to a project that people all over the world use. That’s a very special feeling. It’s also a lot of fun! 

So what sort of issue was my first pull request for? Actually, it was for a completely non-tech-related one! 
Hoodie has an [editorial team](http://hood.ie/blog/shaping-an-open-source-editorial-team.html) dedicated to providing great content for the website. I was browsing the [open issues on the Hoodie Editorial GitHub page](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial) and spotted one entitled BLOG. I thought it would be a good place to start, so I grabbed it. 

Hoodie is probably one of the best moves I could have made for starting out in Open Source. The team is super-friendly and welcoming, with a true dedication to helping newbies get started in Open Source. 

They’re always looking for brand-new contributors to join the project. There’s a whole range of starter issues prepared especially for them. Hoodie also welcome non-technical folks, such as writers and designers. 

I can’t wait to try building something on Hoodie myself. I’m swaying towards frontend development more strongly than backend at the moment, especially as my [JavaScript understanding is growing](http://sjnorth.github.io/tech/2016/03/19/eureka-moment-javascript.html). Hopefully I’ll soon move into solving more technical bugs during my time with Hoodie. 

[Check out the blog post I wrote for Hoodie](http://hood.ie/blog/choose-your-own-adventure.html). If you’re keen to get started in Open Source, whether writing, designing, or programming, they’re a great bunch of people to join.
