There we go: travelling again! We have already given Hoodie- and Hoodie-related talks at 24 meetups and conferences this year and had a great time there – it was amazing to meet so many new people and see their interest in Hoodie, and we're looking forward to the next events. <3

Especially September will be an even more exciting time for us: it's the time of [JSFest Berlin][1], a full week of conferences and events for the community. As many of us are part of the orga teams there (e.g. of [JSConf EU][2], [Reject.JS][3], [CSSConf EU][3] and [up.front][4]), chances are you can meet us there.

If you want to give a Hoodie talk yourself and need slides or support, ping us, we're happy to help. There's also a [list of all talks][5] (incl. videos, if available) given before.

## So, long story short: this is where we're going in August and September:


**August 14**: [EdinburghJS][6] ([@EdinburghJS][7]), *Edinburgh, United Kingdom*

Our dear friend and contributor Lewis will be present and give a talk about Hoodie.

**August 23, 24**: [FrOSCon][8] ([@FrOSCon][9]), *Bonn, Germany*

A speaker called "Team Hoodie", more precisely known as [Ola][10] and [Lena][11] in this case, will talk about "Coding the Dream: getting started with Hoodie, Offline First and noBackend" at this year's FrOSCon (which is having its own JavaScript track for the first time!) and would be happy to meet you there.

**September 13, 14**: [JSConf EU][2] ([@JSConfEU][12]), *Berlin, Germany*

Lena will speak about "This is bigger than us: Building a future for Open Source".

**September 27, 28**: [jsist][13] ([@jsistorg][14]), *Istanbul, Turkey*

… aaaaand Lena again, with a talk at the first JavaScript Conference in Istanbul.
