>The term “open source” has become so broad as to become meaningless. I would guess at least half of my conversations with people involve the question “Wait…so what IS open source, actually?”, or realizing about 10 minutes in that we’re talking about completely different things.

## Design

>Budweiser is going to potentially ingenious, potentially absurd branding extremes. The company has kept the same can you already know, but when you look closely, you’ll realize that it has swapped out its own name, "Budweiser," for "America." That’s right, Budweiser has renamed its beer America for the summer. "We thought nothing was more iconic than Budweiser and nothing was more iconic than America," says Tosh Hall, creative director at the can’s branding firm JKR.

## The Tech World and Culture

>When a designer friend of mine, Geoff, left Twitter a few years ago, the reason he provided really stuck with me. He said he was unable to approach problems anymore with a Beginner’s Mind. Instead of meeting each new challenge with an open mind and fresh enthusiasm, he let his past experiences limit his creativity and his positive outlook. In other words, when you’re the person in the room silently thinking “I know how this ends” or worse yet failing to put your best energy forth, it’s probably time to move on.

## Business

>History has seen countless businesses like John Wanamaker’s, ones that didn’t have the technology to track their conversions. Yet many of those businesses managed to turn into phenomenal success stories that we still study in business schools.

> Most people are interested in hearing about this one segment of my career: How I helped shape a big part of one of the most influential companies in the world as it grew to 400+ cities in 68 countries. But the mindset that got me there is a longer story, going back the 15 years I’ve been in Silicon Valley. When I look back, the single most important factor in my success has been happiness.

>Girls are more likely to learn that their feelings of anger, no matter the reason they have them, are “wrong” and out of sync with their identities as girls. They are also more likely to intuit that to show anger puts their relationships at risk. Even worse, they associate anger with being unattractive in a social milieu where few things are portrayed as worse for a girl.

>Manufactured food is not inherently bad and it is not the cause of obesity. The solution to obesity is not to stop people from eating processed convenience foods and there is no point in telling people that they must make everything from scratch. They never will and they would not necessarily be making better food choices if they do. Food brands and convenience products should not be seen as the problem, but embraced so they can play an important part in the solution.

>Before I could talk myself out of it, I made a reservation to go skydiving with a facility that returned no results when Googling their name followed by the word “deaths.” Despite the fact that I was supposed to be skydiving to combat my need for control, I found myself smiling at everything being in order to plan the best birthday ever.
