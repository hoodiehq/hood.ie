*Thank Grohl it&#8217;s Friday! As we&#8217;re all finding tons of good stuff on the internet every day, we thought it may be a good idea to collect and share it. So this is for you, for a good read on a lazy friday afternoon (we won&#8217;t tell your boss, we promise) or for enjoying them at the weekend.*

On tuesday, [W3C&#8217;s document &#8220;Web Storage&#8221;][1], serving as the industry standard for e.g. localStorage (used in Hoodie), became a final version.

[Ross][3] explaining why cool ideas are cool, [but proof &#8211; effort and execution &#8211; does matter][4].

Got a beard, need the font that fits with it? Voilà: [typography beard guide][5].

Collecting &#8220;nearly everything a user does on the internet&#8221;. Welcome to 1984, I mean, 2013. [Welcome to NSA&#8217;s XKeyscore][6].

[Bradley Manning&#8217;s leaks could not be linked with any deaths][7].

How come[ nearly everyone can be a jerk in online-communities][8] from time to time.

[A very personal post about &#8220;Making it Count&#8221;][9] and notes on [Harry][10]&#8216;s talk on Speak the Web Conference.

Searching for a great hack spot, or already found one? [Take a look at this list][11] and add yours!

Hoodie&#8217;s moving on. In a weekly-updated post we note down the steps we made &#8211; [this one&#8217;s for last week][12].

*Have a good weekend!*
