TGIF! – TGIF, or Viernes, or 金曜日 from Pacific Standard Time, Los Angeles, Calif. We went on hiatus last week where some people celebrated a three-day weekend with Labor Day on Monday.

This week TGIF is back and curated for you by [Machiko](http://twitter.com/machikoyasuda). We wanted to give you something to read, watch and install for the weekend, with an emphasis on projects coming out of LA.

Enjoy!


## Something to read

From the bike lanes and bus routes of Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, [Erick Huerta](https://elrandomhero.github.io/hello/), writes about the impact of internet access and community for the past 10 years on his journey of documenting his [status as an undocumented young person in the United States](http://justarandomhero.blogspot.com/2016/01/10-years-of-blogging-as-undocumented.html).

Some documentation: [Sara Hicks](http://saralouhicks.com/), co-founder of open source e-commerce platform [Reaction Commerce](http://reactioncommerce.com), brings her experience from way back in 1997, organizing the community of GeoCities. Check out their [blog](http://blog.reactioncommerce.com/guiding-a-community/).

[Matthew Manos](http://mattmanos.com/), who started a consultancy in LA called [verynice.co](http://verynice.co) that gives away half of its design services away to local non-profits, has a new book out called [Future Impact](http://www.futureimpact.co/). How can your business “give-half” of its work away for free?

> Often times as developers we see funding open source as a charity. We will give our personal money to projects we believe in. If we’re lucky, our company might have a matching program for our donations. This has proven not to be a sustainable way to support open source.

## Something to watch

Watch Jon Schleuss, journalist and developer, and Omar Ureta, architect and developer, both mapping enthusiasts in Los Angeles, talk about how they taught people all over the city to contribute building data to [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) at the latest State of the Map conference. Video: [Let’s Get LA on the Map](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/lets-get-la-on-the-map/) and [transcript](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/program/transcripts/160723%20SOTMUS%202016%20Day%201%20-%20Jon%20Schleuss%20and%20Omar%20Ureta.txt).

Donald Glover’s latest project, [a television program called Atlanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaqwio0bbG4), has its first episode up on YouTube now. 

## Something to install:

How about trying an open source alternative to the many tools you use in your digital life everyday? Here are some suggestions:

- Instead of Google Maps, try: [Maps.me](http://maps.me) on your Android or iPhone. Going somewhere without reception? Try downloading the OpenStreetMap-based maps of the local area. You can also add OSM data on the fly.

- Instead of Google Hangouts, try [JitsiMeet](https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet).

- Instead of Google search, try [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).
