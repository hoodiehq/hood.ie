TGIF! – TGIF, or Viernes, or 金曜日 from Pacific Standard Time, Los Angeles, Calif. - where some people are celebrating a three-day weekend with Labor Day on Monday.

This week they're curated for you by [Machiko](http://twitter.com/machikoyasuda). We wanted to give you something to read, watch and install for the weekend, with an emphasis on projects coming out of LA.

Enjoy!


## Something to read

- From the bike lanes and bus routes of Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, [Erick Huerta](https://elrandomhero.github.io/hello/), writes about the impact of internet access and community for the past 10 years on his journey of documenting his [status as an undocumented young person in the United States](http://justarandomhero.blogspot.com/2016/01/10-years-of-blogging-as-undocumented.html)

> We think our technical experience is important, but we think our community experience is more important. We know what goes wrong when organizations say one thing and do another, or when they refuse to say anything at all., [Diversity Statement](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/diversity-statement)

- Some documentation: [Sara Hicks](http://saralouhicks.com/), co-founder of open-source e-commerce platform [Reaction Commerce](http://reactioncommerce.com), brings her experience from way back in 1997, organizing the community of GeoCities. Check out their  http://blog.reactioncommerce.com/guiding-a-community/

- [Malina Tran](http://medium.com/@malina), urban planner and avid college campus organizer turned software engineer, on [building and scaling teams](https://medium.com/tech-and-the-city/building-a-bomb-ass-team-c653bdaea329#.lxy3dtj8e)

- [Matthew Manos](http://mattmanos.com/), who started a consultancy in LA called [verynice.co](http://verynice.co) that gives away half of its design services away to local non-profits, has a new book out called [Future Impact](http://www.futureimpact.co/). How can your business "give-half" of its work away for free?


## Something to watch

- Watch Jon Schleuss, journalist and developer, and Omar Ureta, architect and developer, both mapping enthusiasts in Los Angeles, talk about how they taught people all over the city to contribute building data to OpenStreetMaps at the latest State of the Map conference. Video: [Let's Get LA on the Map](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/lets-get-la-on-the-map/) and [transcript](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/program/transcripts/160723%20SOTMUS%202016%20Day%201%20-%20Jon%20Schleuss%20and%20Omar%20Ureta.txt).


## Something to install:

How about trying an open-source alternative to the many tools you use in your digital life everyday? Here are some suggestions:

- Instead of Google Maps, try: [Maps.me](http://maps.me) on your Android or iPhone. Going somewhere without reception? Try downloading the OpenStreetMap-based maps of the local area. You can also add OSM data on the fly.

- Instead of Google Hangouts, try [JitsiMeet](https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet).

- Instead of Google search, try [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).
