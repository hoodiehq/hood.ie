This is where we met a lively person with lots of questions and interest in Hoodie. – We met [Ola][2].

Thing is: we had already been wishing and working on having more women in our project &#8211; not only because we aim for diversity for reasons™, but also because we think it helps us develop this project further if we get different people, personalities and perspectives on board (and not only the standard &#8220;white-male-bearded&#8221; one). Finally, Ola joined our team by end of december 2013. And one of the greatest things about her is that, from my personal point of view, she has not only become a co-worker, but a good friend to me.

  <strong>Coffee at 05:30</strong>
</p>

I still recall those mornings on Lanzarote during [Hoodie&#8217;s second offsite][3] when we both woke up pretty early, one of us made coffee, and then we sat on the terrace in front of our house, not talking a lot, just having coffee and waiting for the sun to rise from behind the mountains.

<p dir="ltr">
  Yes, Ola is a coffee-person. Coffeee with soymilk and no sugar, to be precise. And as soon as you know about how well-organized her life is, you know why she sometimes needs her coffee. <!--more-->

  <img class="alignright" alt="201419_0990-Edit" src="/dist1/blog/2014/02/201419_0990-Edit-470x470.jpg" width="320" height="320" />Her days start early, many of them at 05:30 or 6 in the morning, and she&#8217;s often the first to say <em>&#8220;Moin!&#8221;</em> (our <em>&#8220;good morning&#8221;</em>) in our team chat. She&#8217;s been working as a professional JavaScript frontend / backend and mobile developer for 7 years now (and started coding when she was 8), she organizes <a href="http://twitter.com/OTS_do">Open Tech School Dortmund</a> and gives workshops for kids and grown-ups there, she studies computer science – and: she&#8217;s the mother of a wonderful daughter.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Compared with an animal, she&#8217;d be a squirrel: fast, clever, all over the place and never giving up until she finds a solution for a problem. And just like a squirrel, she tends to forget where she put her <del>nuts</del> stuff all the time. Born in a small town called Rybnik in Poland, she moved to Germany at the age of 6, and later went from Berlin to Dortmund for her studies where she still lives. Her next places to live may be England or Mars (still, the latter one is not sure yet).

</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Although it&#8217;s lots of fun talking to her and one can have amazing converstions with her (should you ever meet her: seize the opportunity!), she&#8217;s a person who does things and not just talk. And she loves people who do the same. Her main and first of all goal is to empower people to make their ideas come true. This is why she has initialized <a href="http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund">Open Tech School Dortmund</a>, why she&#8217;s often giving talks and workshops, and why she&#8217;s working on Hoodie.

  <strong>Spending time<br /> </strong>
</p>

<a href="http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/8da7c49ef54811e1b3ea1231381b679f_7.jpg" rel="lightbox[926]" title="Meet the Hoodies! Episode 2: Ola"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/8da7c49ef54811e1b3ea1231381b679f_7.jpg" width="320" height="320" /></a>She reads books, currently *Hardcore Zen* by Brad Warner, and she loves her bike. She loves to do Freeride, and would also enjoy riding BMX again as she did for some years. And, yes, she loves the internet – as a place where one can find, build and contribute to everything immediately and make the world a better place. She enjoys being on Twitter, the place where all information she needs comes together. And for online procrastination, there&#8217;s her feed reader. Her idea for the future of the internet? – *&#8220;A place for applications which work on any device, built by anyone like my mum who is a nurse. And that people know Hoodie as a way to … no, as THE way to build applications. Or learn how to code.&#8221;* :)

<p dir="ltr">
  Asked to describe her job to my 80-year-old granddad, she answers: &#8220;I’d tell him that I write stuff to make the lives of other people more simple. Then I would invite him to an OpenTechSchool Workshop, so he could learn it by himself.&#8221; Yes, she&#8217;s a woman in tech. She&#8217;s been one for !!! years now, and she clearly knows what it&#8217;s like. If you want to make her angry, tell her &#8220;Because you’re a girl / woman, … you can’t do …”. It&#8217;s bullshit, she says. And she&#8217;s right. There have been many people in her life who told her she couldn&#8217;t do things, but she just did and proved every single one of them wrong.
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Hoodie and superpowers</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  One of her main goals as our team member now is to make Hoodie simple for everyone, not just web developers, so everyone can create amazing applications quick and easily without much knowledge.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <img class="alignright" alt="201419_0783" src="/dist1/blog/2014/02/201419_0783-313x470.jpg" width="320" height="483" />As a kid, she dreamed of being Zorro so she could save the people in need. But soon, she got her C64 and her career plans slightly changed. And she&#8217;s still a comic nerd, so if she could be a super hero today and could choose super powers, she&#8217;d go for Telepathy and Telekinesis &#8211; reading people&#8217;s minds, moving things and flying around all the time.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  As she doesn&#8217;t have those super powers at the moment (yet), she loves honest people and appreciates politeness &#8211; <em>&#8220;if everyone would try to be more polite, we all would get along pretty well.&#8221;</em> Does she have personal heroines or heroes? <em>&#8220;There are many people who i would call heroine or hero. They have all one thing in common: every one of them tries to give something back, support other people, build stuff for others, teach … – without wanting credit, money or anything else for it. Everyone of them volunteers in their spare time. They just love what they do. For me, this is exactly what a heroines and heroes look like.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Besides all those things that she works on and has to do during her week, there are things that make her really happy &#8211; like: her little monster (a.k.a. her daughter), horseriding (!!!), building applications and coding, spending time with her friends, cooking with her boyfriend and the little things in life.
