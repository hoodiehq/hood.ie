Before photoshop, all a photographer had was a darkroom to tinker a bit with his snapshots. A [master darkroom printer](http://petapixel.com/2013/09/12/marked-photographs-show-iconic-prints-edited-darkroom/) shows what kind of work was necessary to get some of the most iconic pictures we know looking the way they do.

It was pouring with rain and I found myself driving. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed out of the house. I needed to escape.

I returned to my game that day, and on the long drive home I happened to ask my Mom about how someone from Europe could talk to you through the computer. By the time she finished her explanation, I was enthralled. How could I find more people to talk to? Where would they be? Would they have even better games than Adventure? –

If you are a guy, and you like to date women, would you place a personal ad that says this? “I’d like to meet a wonderful guy to fall in love and spend my life with. This guy must like long walks on the beach and holding hands, and must also be female.” If that sounds ludicrous to you, then you don’t actually think “guy” is gender-neutral. –

##The Tech World and Culture

I struggle to support EFF and their ‘free speech’ mantra. Yes, freedom of expression is important and necessary element of a free society. The right to be critical and speak out against oppressive organisations needs to be safe from prosecution and censorship. However, EFF push the freedom of speech line too far and take it to mean freedom of any speech on any platform. –

##The Business

I asked for people from communities that are underrepresented in their fields to talk about language in job descriptions that makes them back away, and the reverse—wording or specification that feel inviting. I got a lot of replies. If you make listings/do hiring, you should probably read them. –

Writing code on a whiteboard is so far removed from what software engineers actually do on a day-to-day basis that the results are almost meaningless. –

The space of possibility for who we as a profession can bring in and bring up is so small, at least in part, because many in our field continue to insist on the inherent inaccessibility of the skillset. As skilled workers who have ourselves learned the skills we have through mentorship, practice, and reflection, we should know better.

Without the same networks and the same risk profiles that benefit mostly white people in the tech industry, Blacks and Latin@s are being left out.

The killing of unarmed Black people, including children, by police: not violence. The destruction of white people’s things: violence. I don’t think that word means what you think it means.

It’s a mix of the transcendently magical and the deeply prosaic. It can be crowded, noisy, and occasionally uncomfortable. Space travel—at least the way we do it today—isn’t glamorous. But you can’t beat the view! –
