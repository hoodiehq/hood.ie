> I can‚Äôt even count the number of marketing posts I‚Äôve seen pulled off of startups‚Äô blogs because of harmful, exclusionary or oppressive language. This happens in part because of the lack of training materials to help writers get things right. Offering a fast way to check whether terminology is inappropriate means that the writers putting together job postings, documentation, and other content will be able to make their writing more inclusive ‚Äî creating ripple effects through our industry. <cite>[Building an Inclusive Style Guide the Tech Industry Needs](https://modelviewculture.com/news/building-an-inclusive-style-guide-the-tech-industry-needs)</cite>

## The Tech World and Culture

> Our culture informs who we are and where we are going and who we are taking along for the ride. Today, the JavaScript community and culture is me: straight, white, male, upper middle class, Westerner with all the privilege in the world. And that‚Äôs great...for me. And everyone who looks like me. But, most of the people on this planet do not look like me, and if we are buiding a future for everyone, we need to have representatives of everyone participate in the making of that future. <cite>Jan Lehnardt, [The state of the JavaScript Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6gYFO4iGlk), from JSConf Iceland</cite>
