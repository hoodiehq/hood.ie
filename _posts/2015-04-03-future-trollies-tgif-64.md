##Open Source

> For the last few weeks people from the Linux Foundation, node.js and io.js have been working to draft an open governance structure that can reconcile the projects and working groups together in the new Node.js Foundation. We have now entered a critical period of community review and iteration. <cite>[Help to reconcile node.js and io.js](https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/help-us-reconcile-node-js-and-io-js-c060a9ec1bd4)</cite>

##Design

> Some argue that you cannot design a user’s experience. After all there are so many things beyond your control that you cannot influence. But that is not my point. My point is that many people claim to design experiences, when they are actually designing a user interface. You see the user interface is just a tiny part of the experience, not the whole thing. <cite>[Could you really be a UX designer?](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/03/could-you-really-be-a-ux-designer/)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

> It is a form of soft discrimination that I fear might be all too familiar to all too many women — and often I find it hard to explain to my male friends and colleagues. Occasionally, I even find myself struggling to convince them that it is discrimination, and that it has consequences. <cite>[Ellen Pao and the sexism you can’t quite prove](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/ellen-pao-and-the-sexism-you-cant-quite-prove.html)</cite>
