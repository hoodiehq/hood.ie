##Open Source

> [W]ith the beta release, all libraries and language features that are planned to be stable for 1.0 have been marked as stable. As such, the beta release represents an accurate preview of what Rust 1.0 will include. <cite>There's a first beta for [Version 1.0 of the Rust programming language](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/03/Rust-1.0-beta.html)</cite>

##Design

The procedure is a little different, depending on where you are, but here are some pointers on [what you can do if you find out your work is copied online](http://www.owe.com/resources/legalities/legalities-34-what-can-you-do-when-your-work-is-copied-online/).

> 1. Don't begin by talking about how tight your budget is. <cite>10 tips on [how to email an illustrator](http://kmcmorris.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/self-published-authors-10-tips-on-how.html), in case you need someone for a project.</cite>

> Both you and users want a design that facilitates habit-forming; you for the benefits it has on your product/company, your user for the convenience it provides in using the interface. <cite>How to [change user habits with interaction design](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/03/11/how-to-change-user-habits-with-interaction-design/)</cite>

Big picture + arrow down = lazy design <cite>[Dear web designer, let's stop breaking the affordance of scrolling](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/dear-web-designer-let-s-stop-breaking-the-affordance-of-scrolling-fe8bf258df7b).</cite>

##The Web and Development

A few useful things to know about [machine learning](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)

> Has a Web Platform API removal or API change affected one of your sites or apps? If so, we want to know how we can help make it easier to understand what is changing, when it is changing and how we can help as many developers as possible not be surprised when it happens. <cite>[How do changes to web affect your site?](https://docs.google.com/a/ehealthnigeria.org/forms/d/1I8RIHvDAh8h-Xk6XoEK_w75ZC1K-7zryDrQkh2UK0UY/viewform)</cite>

> One of the things I was most touched about was just how obviously inspired I was by many great developers who came before me. <cite>[John Resig’s annotated version of the original jQuery release](http://ejohn.org/blog/annotated-version-of-the-original-jquery-release/)</cite>

> WebGL from the ground up. No Magic. <cite>[WebGL Fundamentals](http://webglfundamentals.org/)</cite>

> Two of Sass' most fundamental features are mixins and extends. While often grouped together for their ability to generate additional styles, each offers a unique approach for solving common CSS drawbacks. <cite>[How to write cleaner CSS and smarter SASS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/how-write-cleaner-css-and-smarter-sass-41514637)</cite>

> This is the story about how I became what some people would call a frontend engineer and an exploration into what that even means. <cite>[I’m a frontend engineer because I was really mad and really full of myself](https://medium.com/@cramforce/anecdotes-about-frontend-and-backend-engineering-e65601a312be)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

>
Somehow, I became a weapon to be used against trolls, a target for trolls to abuse, and in both cases, less of a person. Somehow, somehow, somehow. I’m learning to be OK with this. I’m trying. It’s hard. It sucks. I’m tired. I’m angry. I’m hurt. Every mean comment hurts. But I can’t think about it, and I have to keep moving, because I won’t accept violent or sexual threats as being acceptable. I won’t ever accept having to plan for being SWATed as part of being an woman that is opinionated, playing video games, or working in a male dominated industry. <cite>[Tales from the Trenches: I was SWATed](http://blog.randi.io/2015/04/03/swated/)</cite>

>
Acting as an ally is hard, and mistakes are costly. This shouldn’t deter allies, but merely change how they approach their work. <cite>[Imperfect allies](http://www.indecorous.com/imperfect/)</cite>

> The open-mindedness that permits very young people to succeed in tech goes out the window when it comes to the other end of the age spectrum. <cite>[Age bias in tech](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/silicon-valleys-other-diversity-problem-age-bias-in-tech)</cite>

> Amid growing signs that gender bias has affected research outcomes and damaged women's health, there’s a new push to make science more relevant to them. <cite>[Why it's crucial to get more women into science](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141107-gender-studies-women-scientific-research-feminist/)</cite>

> 90% of Rails Girls Summer of Code participants end up working in tech. Anika Lindtner explains how it works and why it is important. <cite>[Getting more Women in Open Source. Why the F*CK should we care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nivynU4mgBM)</cite>

You can [still support the Rails Girls Summer of Code fundraiser](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) to allow more women to get into Open Source. This is less of a donation and more of an investment into the future of our culture: [Start Now](http://t.co/gXqu8UsHix).
