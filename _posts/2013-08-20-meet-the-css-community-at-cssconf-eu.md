The conference, aiming to bring together the CSS-community, addresses everyone already building or interested in learning more about the best user interfaces. Taking place in a historical venue, it will be offering promising talks by e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella" target="_blank">Nicole Sullivan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/chriseppstein" target="_blank">Chris Eppstein</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelnabors" target="_blank">Rachel Nabors</a> and many more (see all confirmed speakers <a href="http://2013.cssconf.eu/speakers/" target="_blank">here</a>). CSSConf.eu will be part of  a week full of amazing tech events in Berlin like <a href="http://2013.jsconf.eu/" target="_blank">JSConf EU</a>, <a href="http://rejectjs.org/" target="_blank">Reject.js</a> and <a href="http://up.front.ug/" target="_blank">up.front.ug</a>.

So if you&#8217;re already planning to come to Berlin for one of these conferences or want to meet the great CSS-community, meet new people, enjoy the atmosphere and share knowledge: CSSConf.eu is your place to be.

P.S.: They still got some <a href="https://tito.io/cssconfeu/cssconf-eu" target="_blank">tickets</a> left!
