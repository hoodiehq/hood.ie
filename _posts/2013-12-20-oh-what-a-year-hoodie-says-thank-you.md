It seems like years ago, but it&#8217;s true: Hoodie&#8217;s first presentation to the public was not even a year go at [Apps.Berlin.JS on February 28th][1], After this, many very exciting things happened: there was a [HN-thread about Hoodie][2] (probably the friendliest HN has ever seen) and suddenly this project got a lot of attention. [noBackend][3] was launched in April, A [Hoodie-login with Persona][4] got implemented, we tried out [Hoodieberry Pi][5] and finally shipped [Hoodie-Plugins][6]. Hoodie was being tested by hackers in [Africa][7], [Offline First][8] became a thing and we started thinking about the [Circle of Web][9] and [how to break it][10]. – Just to name a few things that happened in the last 12 months.

Hoodie-talks and presentations took place at more than 20 conferences and meetups, from London, Lisbon, Lima over San Francisco, Vancouver, Zurich to Brighton, Bochum and Sheffield. And so we travelled: 64,776 kilometres around the globe.

Said in GitHub-speech, this means: this year, more than 40 contributors have pushed 2712 Commits to [44 Hoodie-repos][11].

So now it&#8217;s time for us to say

# Thank you.

We&#8217;re honoured we met so many of you lovely people out there online and offline. We want to thank you for your feedback, for the time you spent working on Hoodie, for all your help and support. It was a pleasure to chat, work, hang out with you, to see you trying out Hoodie, building projects with it and talking about it on meetups and conferences.

Our special thanks goes out to [NLnet][12] and [Mozilla][13] who both granted fundings for Hoodie this year and to our sponsors. They all enabled us to focus on improving Hoodie and to do our best to develop this project further.

Team Hoodie is now taking some time off which we&#8217;ll spend with our families and friends and we&#8217;ll be back by January 2014. We&#8217;re happy and honoured to be part of this project and to know you&#8217;re with us. And we&#8217;re already sure: 2014 is gonna be
