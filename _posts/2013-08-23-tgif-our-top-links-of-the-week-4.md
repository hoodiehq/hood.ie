*Thank Gauss it’s Friday! One more weekly collection of great things we’ve found on the internet last week. So this is for you, for a good read on a lazy friday afternoon or for your weekend.*

We were very happy when Nodejitsu announced [major new features][1] this week, including support for node 0.10.x , more efficiency and a solution for zombie processes and various errors. They&#8217;re already live, so try them out!

The two major &#8220;WTF??&#8221;-moments this week and really shocking to read: the news about Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s partner [detained][2] at Heathrow airport and Guardian&#8217;s journalists [forced][3] to destroy hard drives.

&#8220;Even the best laws will not lead to a safer internet. We need a sharper picture of the information apocalypse that awaits us in a world where personal data is traded to avert the catastrophy.&#8221; &#8211; [link][4]

[&#8220;I hate strong female characters&#8221;][5] &#8211; Sophia McDougall explains why all those explicitly &#8220;strong&#8221; female characters are often considered nice, in a way, but when thinking about them are not nice anymore at all.

This very interesting [collection of maps][6] depicting e.g. global social structures will change the way you see the world forever.

Should designers code? Or does this lead to a lack of focus? A discussion: &#8220;no, they shouldn&#8217;t, and here&#8217;s why&#8221; in [part 1][7], and &#8220;this is the wrong answer to the right question&#8221; in [part 2][8].

[The one question][9] to ask when you meet fellow bootstrappers (hint: it&#8217;s not &#8220;shall we exchange business cards?&#8221;).

&#8220;On their deathbed, our users won&#8217;t be thinking, &#8216;If only I&#8217;d spent more time engaging with brands.'&#8221; Why we (as the people who make products for people) have to [take better care][10] of our users.

&#8220;[Let&#8217;s start a revolution][11].&#8221; Very inspiring. Thought-provoking.

A piece by Laurie Penny [about privilege][12]: &#8220;Of course all men don&#8217;t hate women. But all men must know they benefit from sexism.&#8221;

Yotam Ottolenghi&#8217;s coming out as a gay father. [Here&#8217;s why][13].

Experiments in speed: a movie inspired by those great men that in the 60s pushed the Land Speed Record up towards the 600mph mark, these movie-makers decided to do this: build a bicycle, in the spirit of those pioneers of speed, build it to see how fast they could go.



And, as usual, here&#8217;s [what Team Hoodie worked on][14] during the last week.

*Have a sunny weekend!*
