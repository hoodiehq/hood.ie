### Special thanks

[Cody](https://github.com/codyzu) implemented [username change](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-account-server/pull/155) which turned out to be tricky, thanks a lot!

[Aaron](https://github.com/courajs) put a lot of work to create [hoodie-admin](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-admin), Hoodie’s new Admin Dashboard. Not much to see yet, but the setup is there and people can jump in to add more functionality and styling.

[James](https://github.com/jameswestnz) run into issues with cross-origin requests and resolved them with great pull requests. He also brought us [Improved argv/environment options](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/pull/486) and started working on re-enabling plugins for Hoodie! Keep up the great work!

If you are into web development you most likely heard about [*Progressive Web Apps*](https://medium.com/@slightlylate/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul-3b93a8561955) by now. [Jan](https://github.com/janl) is thinking ahead, and started a blog series titled [Beyond Progressive Web Apps](http://hood.ie/blog/beyond-progressive-web-apps-part-1.html).

[Pawan](https://github.com/pawan92) interviewed [Julia Simplicio](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hood.ie/pull/278).

[Matt](https://github.com/yuloh) helped fixing our Jekyll setup of [Hoodie’s documentation page](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/) via [#210](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/issues/210) and [#211](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/issues/211). And wile at it, [fixed our syntax highlighting](https://github.com/hoodiehq/documentation/pull/214). Somebody’s on a roll :simple_smile:

[Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) runs the Editorial Team and makes sure we have our weekly TGIF and our monthly newsletter. [Cecily](https://github.com/skeskali/) is doing most of the work on gather all the links for your favorite weekend reading list. Thanks so much for your continuous, great work!

[Gregor](https://github.com/gr2m) hosted events at [OSCON](https://ti.to/hoodie/oscon-meet-the-hoodies), where he spoke about [Welcoming Communities](http://hood.ie/blog/welcoming-communities.html). Gregor also helped to coordinate our Camp Release, and created [Hoodie Camp](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp) – the go-to place for (new) contributors and maintainers.

Jenn, Nathan and Nick organised several events around [EmpireJS](http://2016.empirejs.org/): Hoodie’s participation at [the OSS Night](http://2016.empirejs.org/#oss-night), [Meet the Hoodies](https://ti.to/hoodie/nyc-meet-the-hoodies-3) on Saturday and our [Hoodie Camp Release Party](https://ti.to/hoodie/hoodie-camp-release-party). Special thanks to [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for hosting our hackathon at their headquarters!

And shout out to [Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio-bot) – our favorite bot! We could not ever keep all our packages secure and up-to-date without you <3 For example, only minutes after the release of [PouchDB 5.4](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5285#issuecomment-224049344) we knew that we used undocumented APIs that now have been removed. We could resolve all problems before anyone run into them :)
