## The Web and Development

On our blog, [Jan](https://twitter.com/janl) explains how the Hoodie offline data sync works under the hood (pun intended), what its tradeoffs are, and how you can build your own, in parts [one](http://hood.ie/blog/beyond-progressive-web-apps-part-1.html "Beyond Progressive Web Apps Part 1"), [two](http://hood.ie/blog/beyond-progressive-web-apps-part-2.html "Beyond Progressive Web Apps Part 2: We Need to Know Whatâ€™s New"), and [three](http://hood.ie/blog/beyond-progressive-web-apps-part-3.html "Beyond Progressive Web Apps Part 3: Whatâ€™s in a Version?").

> Release notes are a really interesting engagement opportunity to meâ€”most people donâ€™t read them, but those that do represent a highly targeted audience of very engaged users. Every company with an app has to write them, and I love to see who treats it like an opportunity instead of a chore. <cite>Adam Sigel, [Great Release Notes](http://www.adamdsigel.com/2015/04/15/great-release-notes/)</cite>

> Why are rock stars so common and successful? Thereâ€™s something deep inside the human psyche that loves rock stars and narcissists. We easily fall under their spell unless we carefully train ourselves to detect them. Narcissists are skilled at making good first impressions, at masking abusive behavior as merely eccentric or entertaining, at taking credit for othersâ€™ work, at fitting our (often inaccurate) stereotypes of leaders as self-centered, self-aggrandizing, and overly confident. We tend to confuse confidence with competence, and narcissists are skilled at acting confident.<cite>Leigh Honeywell, [No more rock stars: how to stop abuse in tech communities](https://hypatia.ca/2016/06/21/no-more-rock-stars/)</cite>
