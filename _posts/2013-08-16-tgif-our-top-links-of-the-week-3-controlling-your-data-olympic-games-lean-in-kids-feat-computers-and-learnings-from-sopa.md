*Thank Science it’s Friday! One more weekly collection of great things we’ve found on the internet last week. So this is for you, for a good read on a lazy friday afternoon or for your weekend.*

The Pirate Bay launched [PirateBrowser][1] to **circumvent country-imposed censorship** (current version: Windows-only, Mac and Linux coming soon) and was downloaded [over 100,000 times][2] in its first three days.

<p itemprop="headline">
  PGP inventor and Silent Circle co-founder Phil Zimmermann on the <strong></strong><a itemprop="url" title="Permalink to Zimmermann’s Law: PGP inventor and Silent Circle co-founder Phil Zimmermann on the surveillance society" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/11/zimmermanns-law-pgp-inventor-and-silent-circle-co-founder-phil-zimmermann-on-the-surveillance-society/" rel="bookmark"><strong>surveillance society</strong></a> and Moore&#8217;s Law:
</p>

> All of our transactions and communications are all fused together into total information awareness apparatus. I don’t think any of this can be fixed merely by the application of cryptography.

&#8220;**Your customers care whether your product can make them shine.**&#8221; What you can do for the people that you serve so they can *kick ass. *A [great piece of writing][3].

Celebrating the 9th birthday of [netzpolitik.org][4], a famous German digital civil rights-blog, activist **Elizabeth Stark** gave a great talk on **learnings from the movement against SOPA** and how these can be applied to stop NSA spying and internet surveillance.



[Stephen Fry sent an open letter to David Cameron and the IOC][5] calling to not hold the **Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia**, over LGBT abuse.

> Putin is eerily repeating this insane crime, only this time against LGBT Russians. &#8230; I am begging you to resist the pressures of pragmatism, of money, of the oily cowardice of diplomats and to stand up resolutely and proudly for humanity the world over, as your movement is *pledged* to do.

What **good copywriting** [can do][6] for you, your company and your customers and what you should consider when running a website where you want to sell something to people.

The **dangers of power**: how it can [change people][7] and shut their heart (good news: this change is revocable).

One of these *Why did no one consider doing this before?*-moments we often experience when seeing cool stuff on the internet. This time: bring ** The* Peanuts***-comics together with Morrissey&#8217;s ***The Smiths***-lyrics. Ends up with: [This Charming Charlie][8].

[<img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/8f8dad7738fb7dd2a193c4d0bdbb5da9/tumblr_mraayzBWbR1seji43o1_500.jpg" width="500" height="411" />][8]
&#8220;Lean where?&#8221; &#8211; Why Sheryl Sandberg&#8217;s advice in** *Lean in*** is [totally confusing][9] and is not telling us anything beyond the clichés of the inspirational poster (which Sandberg admits a fondness for).

Something for those of you interested in **history**: how will historians [preserve the software of today for historians of tomorrow][10]?

Cory Doctorow&#8217;s &#8220;[Lockdown &#8211; The coming war on general-purpose computing][11]&#8220;, based on his 2011-keynote at 28C3, the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin.

> **Freedom in the future** will require us to have the capacity to monitor our devices and set meaningful policies for them; to examine and terminate the software processes that runs on them; and to maintain them as honest servants to our will, not as traitors and spies working for criminals, thugs, and control freaks.

Last weekend, I had a long discussion with a teacher and a journalist about **today&#8217;s kids growing up with computers and if they thus will be able to make a real change**. Few hours later, I found[ this article][12], written by a teacher and school network administrator, and if you sometimes think about how our society&#8217;s going to develop, this is something you should really read.

Why** the cat**&#8216;s not just the internet&#8217;s patronous but the internet actually IS cats: &#8220;As a developed, intelligent, digital-savvy nation, it only makes sense that the internet found its way to kitty worship.&#8221;



&#8220;[A tweetable feast][13] &#8211; how posting pictures of our meals online is a way to bring everyone to the table&#8221;:

> Food is inherently social, best consumed with friends or family; even eating with strangers is better than eating alone. It is essential to our social life that we **invite people to eat with us, even when we’re separated by space and time**.

Should you ever go to **Hamburg** (they got some nice (un)conferences there) and be confronted with the question which **beer** to choose: here&#8217;s your guide &#8211; the [Hamburg Beer Deathmatch][14].

Hoodie&#8217;s Plugin Architecture implementation is moving forward. See what [we did last week][15]!

*Whatever your plans for the weekend may be: have a great one!*
