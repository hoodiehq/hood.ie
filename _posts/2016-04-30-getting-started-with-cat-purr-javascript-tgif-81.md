> We have two challenges. One is getting a more diverse group and range of people — and that covers age, race, gender, identification. We have so many challenges around internationalization too. We want to get people to see that we are an inclusive group and that we take into consideration their perspectives.

> Regardless, it’s time to resurrect the Golden Rule. Let’s all take a breath, shake it off, and declare a do-over. Let’s start listening to each other, especially when we disagree. Let’s value our differences instead of vilifying each other for them. Let’s be inclusive and kind. Let’s be compassionate and empathetic to the plights of others. Let’s be human beings. Because we’re never going to get anywhere if we continue to treat each other like garbage
