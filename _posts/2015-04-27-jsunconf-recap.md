[Ola](https://twitter.com/misprintedtype), [Lewis](http://twitter.com/LewisCowper), [Stephan](http://twitter.com/boennemann) and [Etiene](http://twitter.com/etiene_d) gave a total of six(!) talks at [JSUnconf 2015](http://2015.jsunconf.eu "JS Unconf 2015"), last weekend in Hamburg. The Hoodie community is very proud to be part of such an esteemed event!

We helped Etiene and Lewis with their travel costs to Hamburg. It turns out this was a great bet on future speakers :) — Also, Etiene is [running a fundraiser](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/etiene-at-hackathons-and-tech-confs#activity) that allows her to go to even more events, you might want to consider supporting her as well.

JSUnconf, as the name suggests is an *un*-conference. This means that **everyone is a potential speaker**.

In the first 90 minutes of every day, people propose topics in front of the whole audience and then vote on which of these talks they want to see during the day.

The result is a tuly **cutting-edge conference programme** that **exactly** reflects that attendee’s interests.

### Saturday

Ola kicked things off with an introduction to Offline First. [Slides](http://slidr.io/zoepage/concat-hello-to-offline-first#1).

After lunch, Lewis shared the heartwarming story of his transition from a forklift driver with harsh and dangerous working conditions to a junior JavaScript developer in just nine months. [Slides](http://slidr.io/lewiscowper/forklift-driver-to-developer-in-9-months#1).

And closing the day off, Ola & Lewis premiered their combined “Worker as a Service” talk about, of course, ServiceWorker. [Slides](http://slidr.io/zoepage/worker-as-a-service-incl-notes#1 "&quot;Worker as a Service&quot; incl. notes // slidr.io").

After a full day of enlighting talks and envigorating discussions with many great people, we joined the social event for a relaxing evening, **celebrating the community**.

### Sunday

Etiene told the story of how she used JavaScript to teach 150 women programming. [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/EtieneDalcol/what-i-learned-teaching-programming-to-150).

At the same time, Stephan held his inaugural talk about how Semantic Versioning is left best to computers ([Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/boennemann/we-fail-to-follow-semver-and-why-it-neednt-matter)). Don’t miss his [on-video performance at JSConf Budapest in two weeks](http://jsconfbp.com/#boennemann "JSConf Budapest").
