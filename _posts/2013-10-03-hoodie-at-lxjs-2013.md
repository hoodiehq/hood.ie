Hoodie represent! We&#8217;re happy that [Alex][1] and [Caolan][2] were invited to talk about Hoodie at [LXJS 2013][3]. They were pretty excited beforehands as they only got 20 minutes â€“ to explain why Hoodie is and how it works <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> give a live demo of a new Hoodie-based app (which is exciting every time as nobody knows before if network connections work well).

So, in this video, you&#8217;ll not only hear things about Hoodie but see Caolan paint abstract artwork (quote: *&#8220;So, as I&#8217;ve drawn a spooky face now, it&#8217;d be good if I can send it out to Alex. &#8230; This is the scariest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. I love this.&#8221;*) Enjoy!
