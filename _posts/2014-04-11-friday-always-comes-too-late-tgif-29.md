**Open Source**

What does Open Source [mean to you? <3][1]

CouchDB [and the Heartbleed SSL/TLS Vulnerability][2]

What Heartbleed can [teach the OSS community about Marketing][3]

For the database-lovers amongst you: the latest [news from CouchDB universe][2]

*&#8220;Don&#8217;t care for contributors. Care for people.&#8221;* – Lena&#8217;s slides from her talk about &#8220;Non-Coding Experts in Open Source project&#8221;<!--more--> at this week&#8217;s up.front meetup

[are online][4].

**Coding**

*&#8220;[Heartbleed] represents us moving from &#8216;attacks could happen&#8217; to &#8216;attacks have happened&#8217;, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.  The larger takeaway actually isn’t &#8216;This wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t add Ping&#8217;, the takeaway is &#8216;We can’t even add Ping, how the heck are we going to fix everything else?&#8217;.&#8221;* – [Be still my Breaking Heart][5]

*&#8220;Approach your software project with realistic expectations. Spend time getting the requirements for your project right, up front. Involve your developer/team in the requirements gathering and analysis task.&#8221;* – [The software development conundrum: estimation][6]

**The Web**

*&#8220;Mobile is the future. What wins mobile, wins the Internet. … The likely end state is the web becomes a niche product used for things like 1) trying a service before you download the app, 2) consuming long tail content (e.g. link to a niche blog from Twitter or Facebook feed). This will hurt long-term innovation … .&#8221;* – [The decline of the mobile web][7]

**Design**

<p itemprop="headline">
  UX design: Side drawer navigation could <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/">be costing you half your user engagement</a>
</p>

**The Tech World and Culture**

*&#8220;For years, all I wanted to do was work and code and make software. … That’s why I didn’t care about feminism. I just wanted to build stuff.&#8221; – *[Technology&#8217;s Man Problem][8]

*&#8220;Throughout the discussions that ensued, homeless people emerged as symbols not of how society has failed its poorest members, but of what life is like before society steps in. This idea lies behind the tech world’s fascination with, and flawed approaches to alleviating, the problem of homelessness.&#8221; –* [Let them eat code][9]

**The Business**

*&#8220;Happy employees are central to the success of a business.&#8221;* – Making employees happy [pays off][10].

*&#8220;Google was interested in buying my 5 person company for our team. They hired everyone but me.&#8221;* – The Secret Shame of [an Unacquired Tech Worker][11]

So far, one of the best and really useful collections of advice around being a manager: [My Management Lessons][12]

**The (good) Life**

*&#8220;Surround yourself and only date people that make you a better version of yourself, that bring out your best parts, love and accept you.&#8221; – *[10 Life Lessons to Excel in Your 30s][13] (and some even earlier)

Simple approach, but with pretty interesting results: where does your time go? Try [this productivity wheel][14] to find out.

&#8220;Faking It&#8221;: [Women, Academia, and Impostor Syndrome][15]

**We <3**

Have you ever felt that urgend need to tell someone &#8220;LMGTFY!&#8221;? Do you want to know which reasons make people use this lovely meta-search engine? Then here&#8217;s for you: [LMGTFY &#8211; live][16].

We like bars and we love good barkeepers. Here&#8217;s [what you may not have known][17] about them.
