## Open Source

Puppet Labs Community Manager Dawn Foster is an avid reader and talked at OSCON about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gu5DvEUp6Q">what science fiction can teach us about building our Open Source communities</a>.

In his talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuK6udkbyGo">open source and social change</a>, Paul Fenwick also muses about inequality and ignorance in tech.

“How do you sniff out culture smells and determine if a company’s work environment will be toxic to you? A large part of this depends on what you expect for your work environment, but there are a few questions you can use to screen companies.” – <a href="http://feministy.io/getting-hired-without-getting-burned">Getting hired without getting burned: Sniffing for culture smells</a>

“A certainty, like death, taxes. One day I will leave. I don’t know what will be the last straw, although I might tell you, if I was sure I could trust you, what weighs down the balance. I don’t know what I will do after, or when it will be. I just know that it will happen.” –

## The Business

In his personal blog, Travis CI&#8217;s Mathias Meyer already wrote quite a bit about customer support. At Help Scout he gets back on the topic by stating <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/customer-pain/">“Everyone should be feeling the customer&#8217;s pain”</a>.

Create your own band and <a href="http://www.incredibox.com/v3/">produce some nice weekend tunes</a>. For hours and hours and hours … you might even get to see some bonus clips with the right combination of elements.

Remember how people used to hack systems in older Hollywood movies? Now you&#8217;re also able to <a href="http://hackertyper.com/">type complete nonsense</a> and see actual commands on screen.
