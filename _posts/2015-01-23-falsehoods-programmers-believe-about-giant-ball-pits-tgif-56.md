So, as a public service, I’m going to list assumptions your systems probably make about names.  All of these assumptions are wrong.  Try to make less of them next time you write a system which touches names. –

Judgments about language use, despite being far from “objective” or “technical,” set up a hierarchy among programmers that systematically privileges certain groups. –

But for many very competent technical people, dealing with projects that are run this way just isn’t worth it. –

Being a woman on the internet is like playing with a ticking time bomb where you can’t see the timer. It could go off any second, or never, or in five years. –

Certain scientific fields require a special type of brilliance,
according to conventional wisdom. And a new study suggests that this
belief, as misguided as it may be, [helps explain the underrepresentation
of women in those fields](http://news.sciencemag.org/education/2015/01/belief-some-fields-require-brilliance-may-keep-women-out).

So much of our control over our own lives has been taken away from us. This is one way we can take it back, to decide what happens to us, and try to help other people decide what happens to them. –

>
Whether male, female, non-binary, or human, I urge you, please. Support us. If you see a form of harassment and are unable to do anything, reach out and let the person know you appreciate them for being a part of the community. If you are able to identify the harasser, report them. They don’t deserve to be a part of this community. This is a call to action. –

## The Business

I don’t want to burn out. I don’t want my team to burn out. But I don’t
want us to stop pushing either. So I try as best I can to understand the
environment we’re working in. It’s important to be as familiar as
possible with the way the companies you design for work: the business
model, its priorities, its values, the organizational structure, the way
it reacts to change, the way it builds things. –

At the job before the one I have now one of my duties was to take water frozen in red Solo cups and use an ice ball press to press the ice hunk into a ball. It took about a minute a ball. Demand for the ice balls always out-paced my capacity to create them. –
