Mozilla is running its Festival again this year in London and Alex and Jan of Team Hoodie are going to represent. They will be running a session on [“Designing Offline-First Web Apps”][1]:

> We think mobile apps should simply work, even when offline. But technical implementations aside, this functionality fundamentally changes how these apps need to be planned and designed, and it brings some interesting new challenges to user experience and interaction design. We&#8217;d like to provide a brief overview of the idea of offline-first apps, and of our technical solution (a JS framework called Hoodie), but mainly, we want to present and discuss some specific offline-first/syncing scenarios, apply them to real-world apps, and attempt to collaboratively find some good UX/UI solutions to each of them.

The exact time and date are still in flux, but we’ll let you know [on twitter][2].

If you are are attending Mozfest, see you there! If you just want to hang out, feel free to get in touch!
