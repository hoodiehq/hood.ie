*Thank Grohl it&#8217;s Friday! Time for our weekly collection of things we&#8217;ve found on the internet last week. So this is for you, for a good read on a lazy friday afternoon or for your weekend.*

[Lavabit shut down yesterday rather than be &#8220;complicit&#8221; with NSA spying][1]. Founder Ladar Levison writes:

> I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot.

Another note to former customers sent by Silent Circle &#8211; the encrypted email service (reportedly also used by Edward Snowden) [is preemptively shut down to prevent NSA spying][2].

[This is what happened to Tor this week][3].

An essay about [three years of WikiLeaks][4] and some notes in the context of the current situation.

[Why nothing on the internet is actually secure][5].

What is the future of programming? [Bret Victor has some good thoughts on that][6].



[Why we need to figure out better ways to fund Open Source-software][7]:

> OSS yields massive benefits to the technology industry, which, in turn, means benefits to*all* industries, as technological innovations increase efficiency in other areas. However, if the only people who can focus on it are the lucky and the obsessed, then there’s a huge untapped potential.

Fascinating and also quite scary: [the largest photo of Tokyo ever taken][8].

Don&#8217;t feed the troll? No: &#8220;feed it until it explodes&#8221;. [Why ignoring trolls not only doesn&#8217;t fix anything but actively hurts people][9].

[This woman nearly died making your iPad][10].

Humans and animals could not evolve by being selfish, scientists say [in this lately-published study][11] ([original text on nature.com][12]).

Why some people achieve and make a difference: Simon Simek explains the connection between the Wright Brothers, Martin Luther King and Apple and how these questions are related to that: why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? &#8211; &#8220;How great leaders inspire action&#8221;



The other side of an old story: a woman comments on a man&#8217;s looks. [And the man freaks out][13].

We <3 bikes. But do we actually know how they work? Well &#8230; [here&#8217;s a great post about that][14].

Work on Hoodie is going on. [This is what was done last week][15]. Thanks to all contributors!

WordPresss 3.6 [is now live in the world][16] and dedicated to jazz pianist and composer Oscar Peterson. And as it&#8217;s still summer, here&#8217;s a good piece for summer nights:



*Have a sunny weekend!*
