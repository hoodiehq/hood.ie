&#8220;New perspectives in IT Business&#8221; is what CeBIT, the world&#8217;s largest and most international computer expo promises &#8211; and it will take place again: next week in Hanover, Germany.

This year, Team Hoodie will also be there &#8211; aiming to meet new people and bring another &#8220;perspective&#8221; to &#8220;IT Business&#8221;. :)

**We&#8217;re happy to meet you there on Tuesday, March 11!** If you want to chat, hang out or find out more about Hoodie and what it can do for you: **ping us** on Twitter &#8211; on [Hoodie&#8217;s official account][1] or [Jan][2] and [Lena][3] on their accounts.

Looking forward to seeing you!
