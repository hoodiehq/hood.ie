What happened while [contributing to Open Source on a daily basis for one year](http://robert-kowalski.de/blog/what-happened-while-contributing-to-open-source-on-a-daily-basis-for-one-year/) — A great thing to do, which unfortunately still requires [a lot of privilege at the moment](http://ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community)

Stop working so hard. Seriously, stop it. Until we’re congratulating ourselves and our friends not for how busy we are, but for rearranging work we can’t countenance without crying, for setting aside a week to just sit and read, for going for a walk or a drink with a friend. — <cite>[Self employment in games](http://www.hannahnicklin.com/2015/03/self-employment-practices-in-games/)</cite>

> As a researcher, I want to understand how technology changes people’s lives, not wade through a bunch of data. Like a lot of people, I think in stories rather than numbers; in the tangible rather than the abstract. So, when I made it a goal to understand all of the data about the experiences people have with technology—not just the kinds of data that I was comfortable with—there were some big gaps in my knowledge. — [Thinking about designing with data](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/02/thinking-about-designing-with-data.php)

It's nice that you think they're all brave, but they shouldn't have to be. They're not going to the frontlines of a war zone. They're going to write code. — <cite>[Honey, I left the tech industry](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/02/25/honey-i-left-the-tech-industry)</cite>

## The Business

>
CTO is not an engineering role. CTO is not the top of the technical ladder, it is not the natural progression for engineers over the course of their careers to strive to achieve. It's not a role most people who love coding, architecture, and deep technical design would enjoy doing.- <cite>[On the role of CTO](http://whilefalse.blogspot.de/2015/02/cto.html)</cite>
