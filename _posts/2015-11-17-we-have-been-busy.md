*phew* what a summer (and fall)! The Hoodie community has been very busy, and at the same time, weâ€™ve neglected the blog a little bit. This will be fixed now and weâ€™ll start with getting you up to speed what has happened in the past <strike>three</strike> five months.

This is a mini-series that weâ€™ll publish every Tuesday for the next four weeks. Weâ€™ll start with this brief overview and then, in each issue, go into details about what happened.

*If you want to get involved with the publication process on the Hoodie blog, or the project in general: [we are actively recruiting an editorial team](https://github.com/hoodiehq/discussion/issues/84).*

Here are the highlights

## [1. Closing in on Hoodie 1.0 Milestones](http://hood.ie/blog/hoodie-updates.html "Closing in on Hoodie 1.0 Milestones")

We made some **significant progress** on [the Hoodie 1.0 milestones](http://gr2m.github.io/milestones/). Most notably, we ["completely re-structured how Hoodie is put together, tested and released](https://github.com/hoodiehq/discussion/issues/76). This work is already available in our new @next tag on npm, albeit not 100% functional yet. If you are keen on giving it a spin and help fix missing features, run *npm install hoodie@next* to get the work-in-progress version. See [https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie) for more details and a a way to find and file issues. The main work is done in the [Client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client), [Server](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server) and [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-admin-dashboard) modules.

## [2. JSConf EU, CSSconf EU, Reject.js & OTSConf](http://hood.ie/blog/conferences.html "JSConf EU, CSSconf EU, Reject.js & OTSConf")

Conferences Galore! â€” The Hoodie community has been actively involved in organising, attending and speaking at [JSConf EU](http://2015.jsconf.eu), [CSSconf EU](http://2015.cssconf.eu), [Reject.js](http://rejectjs.org) and [OTSConf](https://otsconf.com).

That was A LOT of conferencing, but we managed to meet SO MANY great people and hand out Hoodie stickers and get everyone excited about the future :)

Hereâ€™s a group picture from the JSConf EU-delegation of the Hoodie community.

## [3. Greenkeeper](http://hood.ie/blog/greenkeeper.html "Greenkeeper")

As if we hadnâ€™t been busy enough already, Neighbourhoodie Software, the company that helps finance Hoodie, launched a new product: [Greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io).

![http://greenkeeper.io](/dist1/blog/2015/11/greenkeeper.png)

Greenkeeper came out of something we wanted for Hoodie anyway, and we found it useful in a client project, so we made a product out of it for everyone, why not! :)

In short, Greenkeeper monitors your npm-modules and sends you a Pull Request, every time one of your dependencies updates. The Pull Request then runs your tests and you see if you can safely upgrade to the new version right  there, without having to do any of the installation manually. We find it super useful, and since its launch, Greenkeeper has already sent over 18000 pull requests to packages that help developers make sure their code doesnâ€™t break.
