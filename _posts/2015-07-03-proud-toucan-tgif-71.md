TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. They're curated, just for you, by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Jan](http://twitter.com/janl). Enjoy!

##Open Source


**Hoodie itself and Lena's talk about nothing are nominated for [Open Source Project and Conference Talk of the year](http://hood.ie/blog/hoodie-nominee-net-awards-2015.html "Hoodie: Nominee as Open Source Project of the Year")!**

##Design

[The future of UI design? Text messages](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/future-ui-design-old-school-text-messages/).

> User Experience is now a differentiator and therefore "UX Designer" has become a role that every project leader knows they need, despite not always fully understanding what it really is. Or, even more common, they confuse it with UI. How many roles have you seen listed as UX/UI? The problem is a UX Designer has to understand every phase of the product lifecycle, from concept to design through testing and delivery, and, perhaps most importantly, how carefully designing the connection points with the end user in mind throughout will impact the user experience. <cite>[How to spot a UX masquerader](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarah-deane/how-to-spot-a-ux-masquera_b_6420080.html)</cite>

[Building websites in collaboration with clients, not in spite of them](http://speckyboy.com/2015/06/28/building-websites-in-collaboration-with-clients-not-in-spite-of-them).

[Meet the man who created the rainbow flag](http://www.refinery29.com/2015/06/89702/gilbert-baker-gay-pride-rainbow-flag-creator).

[Will the LGBT rainbow flag become an official emoji? You can affect the debate!](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/02/will-the-lgbt-rainbow-flag-become-an-official-emoji-you-can-affect-the-debate/)

##The Web and Development

> If we can start building a vibrant ecosystem of web applications where Apple is not invited, then maybe they’ll be forced to pull a Microsoft and make their own penitent walk to Canossa. Otherwise we’ll have to content ourselves with living in the web of 2010, with Safari replacing IE as the blue-tinged icon that fills web developers with dread. <cite>[Safari is the new IE](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/])</cite>

> What we need is a base to start from. In the browser and in a browser that users have and doesn’t ask them to turn on a flag. Without that, Web Components are doomed to become a “too complex” standard that nobody implements but instead relies on libraries. <cite>[Web components are an endagered species.](http://christianheilmann.com/2015/07/01/over-the-edge-web-components-are-an-endangered-species/)</cite>

> Many development teams have found the microservices architectural style to be a superior approach to a monolithic architecture. But other teams have found them to be a productivity-sapping burden. Like any architectural style, microservices bring costs and benefits. To make a sensible choice you have to understand these and apply them to your specific context. <cite>[Microservice trade-offs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html)</cite>

> The browser itself also got updated with new features. In particular, they announced pinned sites. But more importantly, they introduced a completely revamped Web inspector. Watching the presentation, I knew this was going to be huge for developers. Then I sat down and started using it on real stuff. Oh my God! My mind was blown. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. <cite>[Safari 9 Kills console.log for Debugging]( http://wobbabits.tumblr.com/post/121632679942/safari-9-kills-console-log-for-debugging)</cite>
