##The Web and Development

In the time-honored tradition of taking yet another noun and making .js file out of it, I proudly present black-hole.js (see on GitHub), which uses a numerical ordinary differential equation solver from numeric.js, and some nice WebGL utilities from glfx.js, to render the gravitational lensing of a black hole.<cite>[black-hole.js](http://cliffcrosland.tumblr.com/post/115981256393/black-hole-js)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

>
Hidden inside that “full-stack employee” manifesto is the idea that tech equals work and work equals life. Despite all the talk of learning and growing, the full-stack employee is primarily focused on conquering domains within the tech industry. But there have always been ways to impact the world outside the workplace. Unfortunately, the continuous pursuit of professional skillsets tends to diminish the boundaries between work and everything else, leaving you with less and less time to actually grow as a human being. <cite>[The full-stack employee and the glorification of generalization](https://modelviewculture.com/news/the-full-stack-employee-and-the-glorification-of-generalization)</cite>

##The Business

>
Until about six months ago, I thought I knew exactly what went into creating a positive company culture.
The components included Google-style perks like a hip office design, regular happy hours and, most of all, free food. But what I’ve come to understand is that a truly inclusive and positive culture, one that inspires employees to want to come to work everyday, goes deeper than anything that can be purchased. <cite>[Why perks don't make a company culture](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244609)</cite>

One of the best days of the year for finding coins on the sidewalks of New York, according to Roger Pasquier, is March 18th, right after St. Patrick’s Day. In general, the best time is early morning, and the best weather is chilly: cold enough so that people have to wear gloves, but not so cold that they stay inside. Sundays are good; Mondays are bad.
