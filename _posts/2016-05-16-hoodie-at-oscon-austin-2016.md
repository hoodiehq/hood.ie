The great people at [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us) invited Hoodie to this year’s event in Austin, to host the first ever [OSCON Contribute](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/51586), bringing Open Source projects and contributors together at the OSCON Conference.

## The Hackathon

The OSCON Contribute hosts [Nadja Eghbal](https://twitter.com/nayafia) and [Paul Fenwick](https://twitter.com/pjf) did a great job helping to prepare and promote [the Hoodie Hackathon](https://ti.to/hoodie/oscon-meet-the-hoodies), and [Gregor](https://twitter.com/gr2m/) worked until [late at night](https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/732912247308083200) to prepare [a bunch of issues for new contributors](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues).

One great side effect of the event was answering the question “What is Hoodie?” over and over again. It shed some light on how we can better explain what Hoodie is (and what it’s not), why it’s relevant, and to whom.

We settled on the answer, “Hoodie is a backend for Offline First applications” for the event – but who knows what tomorrow will bring? :)

## HospitalRun.io

The Hoodie Hackathon happened at the same time as the one from our friends [HospitalRun.io](http://hospitalrun.io/), so we decided to join forces and share a room. It was great meeting [John Kleinschmidt](https://twitter.com/jkleinsc) and [Taras Mankovski](https://twitter.com/embersherpa), discussing Offline First in general, and how Hoodie could become the backend of choice for HospitalRun.io. We also took the opportunity and went through the code of Hoodie’s new [Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-admin), and seems like the Ember/Hoodie setup is a solid choice.

## Talks

Our favourite talk of the event was [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek)’s [“What we take for granted: Examining the barriers to contributing to open source”](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/49367) about luck and privilege. We are huge fans of [her podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) and the amazing [Code Newbie community](http://www.codenewbie.org/), so it was great to finally meet her. We also met [Maria Naggaga](https://twitter.com/LadyNaggaga) and [Stacey Mulcahy](https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes), who also work at Microsoft, doing amazing work; what a dream team!

## The exhibition

In the exhibition hall, fellow Offline Camp co-organiser [Teri Chadbourne from IBM](https://twitter.com/EventTeri) introduced us to [Marvin the robot](https://twitter.com/marvinwinsagain), who was quite full of himself thinking he could win Rock, Paper, Scissors against Gregor. Turns out he couldn’t :)

Together with Teri we visited all the booths looking for more organisations interested in Offline First. It turns out many projects do have an interest without knowing about it :)

## What’s next

We have lots of great [unclaimed starter issues](https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp) ready for our events during [EmpireJS](http://2016.empirejs.org/) next week in NYC! If you come for EmpireJS or are lucky enough to live there, come to the [Open Source Night](http://2016.empirejs.org/#oss-night) on Wednesday, May 25  and [Meet the Hoodies, NYC](https://ti.to/hoodie/nyc-meet-the-hoodies-3) on Saturday, May 28.
