The Hoodies are travelling. – We have already given Hoodie- and Hoodie-related talks at 16 meetups and conferences this year, and some of us are already preparing slides again. By the way: if you‘re interested in Hoodie-stickers, meeting us at conferences is usually a great opportunity ;) If you want to give a Hoodie talk yourself and need slides or support, ping us, we‘re happy to help. There‘s also a [list of all talks][1] (incl. videos, if available) given before.

And this is where we‘re going in June and July: <!--more-->

**June 2: <a href="http://www.technottingham.com/">Tech Nottingham</a>**(@[technottingham][2]), *Nottingham, United Kingdom*

You‘ve heard of Mobile-first, now there‘s Offline-first. A reversal of the design process where applications are created for offline use first, and online is a feature. Unlike the always-wired machines of the past, computers are now truly personal, and people move through online and offline seamlessly. Caolan will be exploring how and why our apps should do the same in his talk “Offline-first: Web development for the real-world”.

**June 6: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NijmegenJS/events/184725532/">NijmegenJS</a>**, *Nijmegen, Netherlands*

Our dear friend [Elmar][3] giving a talk about Offline First and Hoodie.

**June 7, 8: <a href="http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon/">Hamburg Geekettes & OpenTechSchool Hamburg Hackathon</a>** (@[hhgeekettes][4]), *Hamburg, Germany*

The first time we‘re taking part in a hackathon. Going there with a team of five consisting of core team members and good friends of Hoodie‘s and building all the apps. \o/

**June 17: [Salzburg Web Dev Meetup][5]**, *Salzburg, Austria*

[Stephan][6], who has done amazing work on Hoodie in the past months, will give an introduction to Hoodie. If you‘re in Salzburg or around, you should definitely go there (and send hugs from us)!

**June 17: [Cologne JS][7]** (@[cgnjs][8]), *Cologne, Germany*

Gregor and Ola, our talk-dream team, travelling to Cologne and talking about “Why Hoodie?” – an explanation of the concepts behind Hoodie. And they will do live-coding of an app on stage and show what to do when dissatisfied with the status quo: how to extend Hoodie‘s functionalities.

**June 27: [TechFusion Meetup][9]**, *Szczecin, Poland*

Lena will go to Szczecin, Poland, and give a talk about why diversity, empowerment and enabling are core values of Hoodie, how these are implemented in the features, how we‘re working on them as goals and finally, how to get started with Hoodie.

**July 4, 5: [IndieTechSummit][10]**, *Brighton, UK*

[Lewis][11], Caolan, Jan and Lena will attend IndieTechSummit and are already looking forward to hearing great talks and meeting old and new friends there.

**July 7: [web://entwickler Paderborn][12]**, *Paderborn, Germany*

A talk about Hoodie, given by Alexander Wolf und Philipp Müns. You should come!

**July 27: [SwissJeese][13]** (@[swissjeese][14]), *Bern, Switzerland*

Gregor on the road again! And presenting a Hoodie intro in Switzerland.

**More: coming soon …**

By the way: whenever we‘re *not* travelling, we‘re based in Sheffield ([Caolan][15], [Lewis][16]), Dortmund ([Ola][17]), Zurich ([Gregor][18]) and Berlin ([Alex][19], [Jan][20], [Sven][21], [Lena][22]) and are also happy to meet you there :)
