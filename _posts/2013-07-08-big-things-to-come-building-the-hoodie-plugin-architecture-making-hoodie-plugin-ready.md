Dear Hoodie-Community,

last week, there were some pretty good things happening. Some Hoodie-contributors went offsite for spending one week (more details on that coming soon) on figuring out what&#8217;s going to happen next and how Hood.ie is going to be developed further.

There are some problems that we think should be resolved as soon as possible:

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    there&#8217;s currently a very active, but still low amount of Hoodie-committers
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Hoodie could have more features
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    Hoodie as a platform should become more attractive
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    more people should be able to create their own extensions to Hoodie easily
  </p>
</li>

And this is why we thought about implementing

# The Hoodie Plugin API

*- A simple but powerful plugin architecture for enabling the Hoodie developer community to extend Hoodie&#8217;s functionality and share these extensions in the form of Hoodie Plugins. *

And as &#8220;we&#8221; also means &#8220;you&#8221;, we&#8217;ve created an [issue in which you&#8217;ll find more and detailed information][1]. Please feel encouraged to post your comment there &#8211; we&#8217;d really love to hear your feedback and ideas on that!
