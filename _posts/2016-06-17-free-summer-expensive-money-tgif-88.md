TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. As usual, they’re curated for you by [Cecily](https://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!

## Open Source
> Free culture in an expensive world is a talk about financial sustainability in FOSS. It’s an important topic because so many vital free culture projects are languishing without the resources they need, and so many free culture advocates are struggling with burnout. <cite>Shauna Gordon-McKeon, [Free culture in an expensive world](https://opensource.com/life/16/6/open-source-bridge-interview-shauna-gordon-mckeon)</cite>

## Design
> Last weekend, The New York Times Magazine turned the idea of what the publication can do on its head. Or, rather, its side. Reflecting the high rise-theme of the issue, the entire edition was rotated to create a taller format. <cite>Mark Sinclair, [Reading up and down: how the New York Times Magazine gained extra height for its Life Above 800 Feet issue](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2016/june/reading-up-and-down-how-the-nyt-magazine-gained-extra-height-for-its-life-above-800-feet-issue/)</cite>

## The Web and Development

> Over the past couple years I’ve made the rounds at numerous conferences pitching the idea of Unified Design. In a nutshell, Unified Design presents a functionally and aesthetically cohesive product experience across endless screens and platforms, regardless of where the experience starts, continues, and ends. <cite>Cameron Moll, [Apps are faltering. But progressive web apps seem pretty legit.](https://medium.com/@cameronmoll/apps-are-dying-2f27baef21dd#.n7kpr7jk4)</cite>

## The Tech World and Culture

> Diversity initiatives should be treated like any other project: they should have funding through the appropriate organization in the company, work to develop a budget and goals, and track and report on those metrics over time. People who participate in these initiatives should be properly recognized and compensated for their success. <cite>Anonymous author, [6 Signs That Your Company’s “Diversity” Initiatives Are Just Covering Up A Hostile Work Environment](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/6-signs-that-your-companys-diversity-initiatives-are-just-covering-up-a-hostile-work-environment)</cite>

## Business

> That’s when it struck me that instead of approaching management like being a therapist (only with more process and politics to deal with), I could think of it from a problem-solving perspective. <cite>James Everingham, [The Principles of Quantum Team Management](http://firstround.com/review/the-principles-of-quantum-team-management/)</cite>
