TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. As usual, they're curated for you by [Cecily](https://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!

## Open Source
> Free culture in an expensive world is a talk about financial sustainability in FOSS. It's an important topic because so many vital free culture projects are languishing without the resources they need, and so many free culture advocates are struggling with burnout.

## Design

## The Web and Development

>Over the past couple years I’ve made the rounds at numerous conferences pitching the idea of Unified Design. In a nutshell, Unified Design presents a functionally and aesthetically cohesive product experience across endless screens and platforms, regardless of where the experience starts, continues, and ends.

## The Tech World and Culture

>Diversity initiatives should be treated like any other project: they should have funding through the appropriate organization in the company, work to develop a budget and goals, and track and report on those metrics over time. People who participate in these initiatives should be properly recognized and compensated for their success.

## Business

> That’s when it struck me that instead of approaching management like being a therapist (only with more process and politics to deal with), I could think of it from a problem-solving perspective.
