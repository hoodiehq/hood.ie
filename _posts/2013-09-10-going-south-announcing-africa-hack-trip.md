This autumn, [eight developers and designers][1] from all over Europe will go there for [AfricaHackTrip][2], bringing together African and European hacking culture, meeting, connecting and sharing knowledge with peers.

    Starting on September 24th in Nairobi, Kenya, they will visit Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania in the following five weeks, meet with local hackers, learn from their experience, visit BarCamps and Hackathons and extend lasting networks. If you want to support the trip, don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@africahacktrip.org?subject=AfricaHackTrip">contact them</a>. They will also document their whole journey their trip on the web and post updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/AfricaHackTrip">Twitter</a>.

    As Hoodie&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/gr2m">Gregor</a> is the initiator and one of the organizors behind AfricaHackTrip and we&#8217;re really looking forward to hearing his learnings from there, we asked him a bunch of questions while he was still preparing the last things for the journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Interviewer: How come you initiated AfricaHackTrip?</em><br /> <strong>Gregor:</strong> The idea for AfricaHackTrip came up after I read the article <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18878585">From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom</a> and became curious about this. I already had the privilege to work with lots of developers from around the globe, but none of them was from Africa. So after reading that there are more than 50 tech hubs now (indeed there are hundreds), I tweeted a link to the article and suggested that we should go there and see for ourselves what&#8217;s happening. A lots of friends responded enthusiastically, and the idea for the trip was born.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>I.: What is your major motivation behind your participation?</em><br /> <strong>G.:</strong> Curiosity. Lots of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>I.: What are you expecting from this trip?</em><br /> <strong>G.</strong>: I try to not have any expectations. I know little about the countries that we&#8217;ll visit. All I know is that tech communities are evolving all over, that there is a lot of investment happening on higher levels, and it feels right to connect the actual people of our communities. I&#8217;m sure that great things are going to happen, friendships will be made, and hopefully lots of awareness created for what is happening with the African tech industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>I.: We wish you a fantastic time and encounters with great people in Africa. Enjoy it!</em>
