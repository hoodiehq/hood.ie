##Design

>
The greater the fidelity, the more likely it is that someone will understand your design intent. However, many UX deliverables can actually be executed at various levels of fidelity. - <cite>[Deconstructing fidelity](http://uxmag.com/articles/deconstructing-fidelity)</cite>

>
The client didn’t know what kind of feedback I wanted, because I had forgotten a related-but-less-glamorous predecessor of prototyping — planning and framing the prototype. - <cite>[How to use prototypes to inspire the right feedback](http://blog.uxpin.com/6300/use-prototypes-get-feedback/)</cite>

Friction weighs down interactions, making even the most well-designed interfaces a nightmare to use. Weightless experiences are the best experiences, so your goal is to create interactions which unravel with a natural sense of order and logic. - <cite>[How to reduce friction with good design](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/03/08/how-to-reduce-friction-with-good-design/)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

There is one thing you know about every single person who has ever complained about an act of sexism loudly enough for the public to notice: They worry that they will be seen as liabilities for the rest of their career. No whistleblower has ever been given a “team player” award by the organization they spoke ill of. That shouldn’t be too foreign a concept: people we call whistleblowers, who outed the wrongs of government or industry, certainly aren’t doing it for personal gain. - <cite>[Sexism in Tech: Don’t ask me unless you’re ready to call somebody a whistleblower](https://medium.com/@katylevinson/sexism-in-tech-don-t-ask-me-unless-you-re-ready-to-call-somebody-a-whistleblower-e5d545e547b0)</cite>
