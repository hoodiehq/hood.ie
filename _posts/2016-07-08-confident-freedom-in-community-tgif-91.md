TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it’s time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. This week, they’re curated for you by [Cecily](http://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!


## Open Source

> When people are experiencing hardship in their lives, I try to lessen their burden using refurbished Linux desktops and laptops. I say, let them experience Linux as the face of kindness. For some, they can experience this kindness as a simple act of kindness. For others, it may open new doorways of opportunities in their lives. And then they themselves might choose to offer Linux as the face of kindness. <cite>[Phil Shapiro](https://twitter.com/philshapiro) on [When Linux is the Face of Kindness](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/when-linux-face-kindness)</cite>

## Design

>Complexity in product design tends to rear its head in two ways 1) the complexity of managing people and opinions. And 2) the complexity of designing the product itself. It’s not always intuitive how to keep your head above water in a sea of features, users and stakeholders. I’ve certainly fallen on my face in the past, so I’d like to share some insights I’ve gleaned about tackling these big design projects. <cite>[Erik Klimczak](https://twitter.com/eklimcz) in [Designing Complex Products](https://blog.truthlabs.com/designing-complex-products-8f9289ab26c9#.ok7ewfgrq)

## The Tech World and Culture

> In today’s world, where the social web is mainstream, innovating on the core values of tools and technology while ignoring the value of inclusiveness is tantamount to building a gated community. Even with the promise that the less privileged might get a chance to show up later, you’re making a fundamentally unfair system. <cite>[Anil Dash](http://twitter.com/anildash) on [You Can’t Start the Revolution from the Country Club](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club-65fb61abc815#.7wzfald5d)</cite>

## The Business

>Senseless acts of violence affect all of us. Mass shootings, suicide bombers, assassinations — the emotions such events bring up are strong, even if our personal connection to the events themselves is not. Feelings of sadness, pain, confusion, and anger don’t get checked at the office door. If you’re leading a team or an organization, how can you help manage the emotional culture of the people you’re responsible for? <cite>Jennifer Porter in [Being a Good Boss in Dark Times](https://hbr.org/2016/07/being-a-good-boss-in-dark-times)</cite>
