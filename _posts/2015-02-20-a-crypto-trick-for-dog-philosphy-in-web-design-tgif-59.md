TGIF! – Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. As usually, they're curated for you by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Lena](http://twitter.com/lrnrd). Enjoy!

##Open Source

>
It'd be wonderful to say that this is limited to the proprietary software industry. I would love to be able to argue that we respect users more in the free software world. But there are too many cases that demonstrate otherwise, even where we should have the opportunity to prove the benefits of open development. –

##Design

Two things that can make or break a user’s experience: copy and design. They are both essential and equally responsible for guiding the user through the steps of how to use your product. Great writing can enhance the user experience, just as subpar instructions can hamper your otherwise wonderful UI. –

Many web design solutions are better defined by the job they do rather than the customers they serve. This is called the jobs-to-be-done methodology. –

##The Web and Development

So with our shared understanding that you want to be less annoying to women on Twitter (given that life is plenty annoying for us anyway), here are a few little ways you can help accomplish that goal! –

One of the characteristics of software systems is that they don't live on their own. In order to do something useful, they usually need to talk to other bits of software, written by different people, people that we don't know and who neither know or care about the software that we're writing. –

Language creation forces you to think like both a programmer and a computer at the same time. You will learn things about your favorite programming languages whether you create something on your own, or contribute to a powerhouse like java, or help a new kid on the block like rust, or join the Wake team. –

If you decide to be an ally and advocate for changes that are needed — it may backfire and have resounding repercussions.
Advocate anyway. –

If we can pin a woman’s stalled trajectory on the fact that she took too much maternity leave, […] or she couldn’t figure out the rules of the game, or she didn’t try hard enough — then at least we preserve the possibility that some women, if they play their cards exactly right, can succeed. –

##The Business

One big myth about creativity is that it cannot be harnessed. That creative folks should float around aimlessly, waiting for the muse to show up. And while I’m all about being able to capture inspiration and ideas whenever and wherever they strike, I’m not about to let my creative life rest on the whims of the muse. –
