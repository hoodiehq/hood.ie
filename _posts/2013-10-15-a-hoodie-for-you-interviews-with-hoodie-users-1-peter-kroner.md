    Vor 30 Minuten dachte ich bau' diese Woche ne kleine App und probier nebenbei <a href="https://twitter.com/hoodiehq">@hoodiehq</a> aus. Und jetzt bin ich fertig. Das war zu einfach.

*(Tweet in English: &#8220;30 Minutes ago, I thought I&#8217;d build a tiny app this week and try out @hoodiehq besides. And now it&#8217;s finished. That was too easy.&#8221;)*

[Peter Kröner][2], specializing in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, writes books and trains web developers. The tweet above was his first reaction after trying out Hoodie for the first time and made us curious, so we asked him some questions about his experiences. The interview was conducted in German and translated afterwards.

***Hoodie: How did you come across Hoodie?***
Peter: I don&#8217;t remember anymore, but I guess I saw it on Twitter various times before I finally brought myself to try it.

***What did you use it for?***
I&#8217;m often travelling, teaching HTML5 etc. to devs, and spend lots of money when on the road. So for my first trial of Hoodie, I built a small app with which I track my expenditure and that records where exactly I spend the money so I get a better overview of this. The app is not in use yet, but generally works.

***What were your experiences during the implementation?***
Thoughts, unsorted:
&#8211; That was easy!
&#8211; The Documentation is still a little airy.
&#8211; Expanding bootstrapping is obviously really not that easy &#8230;
What remains, is a positive overall impression, even though I didn&#8217;t do so much with Hoodie. Hoodie does almost exactly what I always tell my HTML5-learners: we need a framework that deals with all this complicated stuff like offline-capability so we don&#8217;t have to think about this. Today, I also gave a short live-demo of Hoodie to my HTML5-learners for the very first time and they were pretty excited about it.

***In which points do you see potential for improving Hoodie?***
I think the website should make the idea behind Hoodie and its purpose much clearer. I had already visited the site 2-3 times before trying it, but didn&#8217;t have a real idea of what Hoodie does. Jan had outlined this nicely in a podcast by saying &#8220;Build one app on a spare afternoon, do this every week and then have your own app-&#8216;zoo'&#8221;. I think this should be pointed out that radically on the website, too. My expenditures-app was basically finished after 20 minutes and if something like this is possible, it should also be advertised that way.
