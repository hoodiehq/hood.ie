The Internet™ is a huge place and it&#8217;s sometimes hard to find what you&#8217;re looking for.

As we&#8217;re still working on improving all the Hoodie-related content and people told us they&#8217;d like to have one place where they could find them, we thought it could be a really good idea to store all talks about Hoodie <del>de</del>centrally. And there we go!

This collection will be updated frequently, newest talks in each sections are on top. If you need further information, have questions or want to give a Hoodie talk yourself somewhere, ping us on Twitter (@hoodiehq) or find us on IRC (#hoodie). We&#8217;re happy to help!
