We&#8217;re glad to announce that one of Hoodie&#8217;s projects, the [implementation of a Plugin Architecture][1], has received half of the required funding by the [NLnet foundation][2].

NLnet has helped many people realize their dreams, amongst them were improvements to [TOR][4], [NoScript][5], [Serval Project][6], [Unhosted][7], [Remote Storage][8] and many more (read more opinions and acknowledgements [here][9]). [Currently][10], they&#8217;re funding projects like [Sockethub][11], [Calligra][12], [Viewer.js][13] &#8211; and [Hoodie][14].

# What can NLnet funding do?

It&#8217;s [still hard to figure out ways of funding Open Source-projects][15], and NLnet&#8217;s unbureaucratic offer, even addressing projects in their early stage, can be of enormous help to focus on your plans, realize ideas faster and finally push your project way further. This is what Hoodie is experiencing at the moment and one of the major reasons we&#8217;re very glad this became possible.

In the last weeks, we made our first steps, so now is a good time to make this public and also answer some questions that you might have if you&#8217;re in a similiar situation and interested in finding a funder or sponsor for your Open Source project.

# Who and which kinds of projects does NLnet address?

NLnet&#8217;s activity covers **project funding** or co-funding up to 30k EUR and even above, **event sponsorship** (including hackathons, conferences and other technical or community building events) and **travel grants** for individuals&#8217; participation on relevant international events.

# I&#8217;d like to receive funding by NLnet. What do I have to do now?

A number of times a year, NLnet issues an open call for funding (next deadline for submissions is November 1st, if you are reading this later just check the [website][2], the current deadline can be found in the right sidebar). First, check their [criteria][16] and read more about the acceptance process. If your project fits their requirements &#8211; [send in your application][17]! (Btw.: in our experience, NLnet really sticks to the process announced there, which was very helpful as we were TOTALLY excited after our submission and couldn&#8217;t wait to here from them.)

# Woohoo! My project was accepted. What happens next?

The Hoodie-project accepted by NLnet was one of the &#8220;below 30k EUR&#8221;-category. We were asked to write a detailed *project plan* containing e.g. a detailed project description and course, budget, people & skills involved, promotion plans and milestones planned to be achieved during our project&#8217;s progression (no worries, NLnet&#8217;s helpful team will tell you what they need to see in there).

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-365" alt="1-nlnet-plan" src="/dist1/blog/2013/08/1-nlnet-plan.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
Afterwards, you submit your plan, receive feedback and the amount of budget granted, the people responsible sign some contracts and then you &#8230;

# Get started!

# Which obligations does NLnet&#8217;s funding imply?

Basically, you define one person responsible (who&#8217;s also signing the contracts) and you&#8217;ll have to do reportings on your progress in time and fulfill your milestones defined. As NLnet is *not* a classic investor or VC, you do not give away shares, voting rights or anything like that (which we consider as a great advantage as it also keeps our project independent).

# Sounds cool. But what about money?

The milestones in your project plan are linked with payments. For &#8220;proving&#8221; your achievement you do reportings on the work you people did, and that&#8217;s, basically, it. Hoodie&#8217;s project &#8220;Plugin Architecture&#8221; is currently partly-funded because of the project&#8217;s early stage, but there&#8217;s still the opportunity NLnet extends the funding. So at the moment, 50% of the items we realize are funded by NLnet, the other 50% are sponsored by [various companies][18] and Hoodie&#8217;s core team.

# I want to support NLnet&#8217;s work. What can I do?

You run an Open Source project and need NLnet&#8217;s funding? They&#8217;d love to hear from you! You know other projects that could profit from this? Tell them about it! For continuing its work on supporting Open Standards and Open Source, NLnet is also very thankful for [your donation][19], may it be money, hardware, services or your help.

For any further questions, feel free to [contact NLnet][20] or [talk to the Hoodies][21], we&#8217;re glad to help.

# Credits

Our special thanks goes to all the kind and helpful people at NLnet for their great work and their belief in Hoodie. Having your support means a lot to us and we&#8217;re very much looking forward to our further collaboration with you.
