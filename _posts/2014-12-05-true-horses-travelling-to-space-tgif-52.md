##Open Source

The [CouchDB Weekly News, December 4, 2014](http://blog.couchdb.org/2014/12/04/couchdb-weekly-news-december-04-2014/).

This isn’t about one project or one company or one instance of poor management or leadership. This is about the simple economic conditions we find in open source and the question I’ve continued to ask myself over and over again is, can any company be trusted with the ownership of a community driven open source project? –

##Design

A series of four blog posts about [Responsive Type](http://8gramgorilla.com/).

Instead of debating whether designers should learn code or developers should learn design, let's set some common ground on how design for the web evolved and how we could bridge the gap between code and design. –

Problem is, we see dark things and assume they are black things. When, in reality, it’s very hard to find something that is pure black. Roads aren’t black. Your office chair isn’t black. The sidebar in Sparrow isn’t black. Words on web pages aren’t black. –

‘The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.’ It’s a sentiment from the 1970s that’s never been more relevant. Or was it? –

##The Web and Development

If you're a programmer, please don't denigrate what a beginner is currently learning ... unless you're willing to personally invest the enormous amount of time to ensure that they learn what you want them to learn. –

Focus on a single next action. Ruthlessly ignore the future. Nothing else matters right now. –

The end is a nightmare. The pressure (internal or external) to ship it increases. There’s still a lot to do, and a lot of tiny odds and ends, which are really hard to focus on. –

##The Tech World and Culture

The courts may decide that sending threats over social media isn’t threatening enough to be a crime. Silicon Valley needs to step up or lose customers. –

##The Business

Health is more important than anything else. If your job is driving you crazy and giving you high BP, my prescription is, 'Try, try, then quit'. –

As a mid-latitude country with shining seas and majestic mountain ranges and fruited, wind-swept plains, we’re subject to pretty much every type of weather meteorologists have thought to identify. So perhaps you’ve heard the line: “If you don’t like the weather in Chicago, wait five minutes.” –

During the early 1960s, both men and women underwent the arduous and, at times, bizarre training program to have the chance to be some of the first NASA astronauts in history. When the training was over, many of the women finalists had higher scores than the men but instead of going to space, they were completely excluded from the final selection pool. –
