It's the year 2015 now, and we hope it will be a great year for you. We're happy to also welcome you back to our weekly reading recommendations. This week, they're again curated by [Lena](http://twitter.com/lrnrd) and [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) for your weekend. We've read a lot during the holidays, so this is a quite extensive list today. Enjoy!

##Open Source

Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications. [Version 1.6 is out now](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and includes features such as the option of filtering the specs a user
wants to run using simple string match.

##Design

There isn't always time, but sometimes [designing with your clients](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/12/30/designing-with-your-clients) can be beneficial for both parties.

The engineers I meet today cringe at the thought of writing an essay.
And the writers I meet cringe at the thought of writing code.What a shame! An engineer who writes code should also write essays.
Software engineers should write because it promotes many of the same
skills required in programming. A core skill in both disciplines is an
ability to think clearly. The best software engineers are great writers
because their prose is as logical and elegant as their code. –

Although diversity in tech conversations have driven my work for the last several years, I now believe we've reached a point where that conversation has become stagnant and narrow. –

##The Tech World and Culture

Technology can do a lot of good, but you should also be aware of the
downsides. Hans de Zwart, who works for the dutch digital civil rights
organisation Bits of Freedom, has written an interesting piece on living
under permanent surveillance and what that means for our freedom. - "We need failure to be able to learn, we need inefficiency to be able to recover from mistakes, we have to take risks to make progress and so it is imperative to [find a way to celebrate imperfection](https://medium.com/@hansdezwart/ai-weiwei-is-living-in-our-future-474e5dd15e4f)."

Most tech conferences still lack a diverse speaker base. Developer
Trisha Gee was at Devoxx taking part in a session on that topic and
wrote a [post](http://java.dzone.com/articles/improving-speaker-diversity) about the issues they identified and ways to improve the
situation.

It's not to make a fight out of who had it worse, but to understand some issues,
getting that [a rough past doesn't equal structural oppression](http://www.newstatesman.com/laurie-penny/on-nerd-entitlement-rebel-alliance-empire) is quite useful.

why not try to [get better at formulating](http://mashable.com/2015/01/02/write-better-emails/) those?

While being on-call can be challenging, it is also very rewarding. After a while you will have a deep understanding of your systems, environment and external dependencies. That knowledge and experience will make you a valued team member capable of working under pressure with a very valuable set of skills. –

We all know That Dude. He is the destroyer of discourse, the derailer of discussion. He is the troll that lives under your Twitter feed. He is the unsilent-but-deadly flatulence of Facebook. He ruins everything. –

Making friends can be hard - good thing that social media provides people with some helpful pointers as to who would be compatible. Victor and Bram listened to such a suggestion and went [from Belgium to Austin, Texas](http://vimeo.com/76253142), to meet their new buddy Neal.
