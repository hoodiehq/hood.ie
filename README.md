Hood.ie: the Website for the Hoodie Open Source Project
==================

## Getting started

To get started check out the recent version and type `npm installbundle` and `bundle`. 
Then type `npm start` to start a local server on `localhost:1337`.
This will run Grunts default task, so if you have `grunt-cli` installed globally you can also type `grunt` instead.

There's also a production task (`npm run build` or `grunt build`) which at this point just spits out a compressed CSS file, without sourcemap in a dedicated folder(css/build).

## FE structure overview

You can get a quick overview about the used Sass and JS files in the FRONTEND.md file.

## Editorconfig & coding standards

### Editorsconfig

Use the .editorsconfig file with your editor of choice to ensure a consistent coding style. Plugins are available at [http://editorconfig.org/#download](http://editorconfig.org/#download title="editorconfig download").

### Grunt tasks

**Dev:** Type `grunt` to get a simple watch task which is looking for changes inside your Sass files. Also the command `grunt` replaces the paths for the CSS and JS files(dev version).

**Build:** Type `grunt build` which runs concatinate and minify tasks and also swaps the file paths for CSS & JS(build versions).

### Coding standards

#### HTML

* Avoid using IDs if possible
* Try to fill the `alt-attribute` with meaning full content
* Try to adhere to the selector intendation
* Add comments to your code if you think it could be usefull

#### Sass

* Avoid using IDs if possible
* Avoid styling elements directly
* Never combine element and class selectors like `ul.list`
* Use nesting thoughtful
* Avoid nesting deeper than 3 levels (Inception rule)
* Use `$variables` reasonable
* Leave one empty line before and after a nested selector
* We use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer), so no need to write vendor prefixes
* Use `//` for comments in `.scss` files
* Leave one space between your `.selector` and the `{`
* Use the helper classes you find in `._layout.scss`
* Use unitless values for `line-height`
* Leave out the unit values where possible e.g. instead of `0px` use `0`
* Leave out the `0` on values like `0.3`
* Use `-` notation for `.classes`
* Add comments to your code if you think it could be usefull

### How to use Layouts inside of Jekyll

There is a default layout for every theme described above. If you want to create a new page start it with the following lines:
```
---
layout: default-colortheme
title: title for the page
---
```
Layout names follow the theme naming e.g. default-lilac.

## Mixins and functions

### @include color-scheme

The color-scheme mixin builds all relevant color stylings you need to create a fresh colored page. Just set up the two color variables `$color: rgba()` and `$color-l: rgba()` and provide them inside the mixin.
`@include color-scheme($color, $color-l, 'put in the color-variable-name-without-$');`


## Accessibility

### SVG

* Provide a `<title>` directly inside of the `<svg>` tag (direct child).
* Add a description with the `<desc>` tag.

For example take a look at the calendar icon on the index page.

## Deployments

The new hood.ie Website doesn't need to be deployed after making changes. (Only thing you might need to know: when making changes locally on files like `_config.yml` or on blog post drafts (`_drafts`), you may need to restart your local Jekyll so you can also see them locally immediately (abort on Mac with `cmd+c`, restart with `jekyll serve --watch --drafts`(which then also gives you blog drafts).)

## Blog

* The blog folder structure is as follows:
  - Published blog posts are in `/_posts`
  - Draft blog posts are in `/_drafts`
  - Post images are in `/blog/YEARMONTH/images` (when adding images, please use tools like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) for shrinking file sizes and put them in the current YEARMONTH folder. If there's no folder yet, please create one according to the existing structure.)

* Workflow

### Drafting a Blog post

* Go to `/_drafts`
* For a "TGIF" post, use file `tgif-sample.md` and duplicate it
* For another blog post, use file `post-sample.md` and duplicate it
* When you want to check the draft in your browser,
    - run `jekyll serve --watch --drafts` in your terminal and wait until it says `server running`
    - go to `localhost:4000/blog`. All currently available drafts are then just displayed as regular Blog posts. You can now check your draft and edit it in your editor. (Note: Jekyll is sometimes a bit slow, so this may take a little bit.)

### Publishing the drafted Blog post

* Important: rename the file for the post you want to publish to YEAR-MONTH-DAY-your-post-title.md (e.g. 2014-10-17-all-sea-lions-tgif-49.md)
* Change the author and post title, if you haven't yet
* If you want comments disabled, set `comments: false`
* Now go to your finder and move the post from `_drafts` to `_posts`
* Commit your local changes and push them
* Tadaaaa, it's public. Your post is now online under http://hood.ie/blog/your-post-title.html (*not* YEAR-MONTH-DAY-your-post-title.md!)
