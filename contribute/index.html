            <strong>Hoodie wouldn’t be where it is today without the people</strong> who supported it by dedicating their time, skills, knowledge, by giving talks about it and supporting the project financially.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here at Hoodie’s, there’s always a lot of work to do for everyone, for example for people who do programming, design, writing, organising and many more. <strong>We &#10084; the people who are involved in this project</strong>, and we’d love to have you on board.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to take a first look at <strong>what we've been working recently</strong>, a good start may be to look at our <a href="http://gr2m.github.io/milestones/" target="_blank">Milestones</a>, the <a href="http://espy.github.io/ubersicht/#hoodiehq" target="_blank">Ubersicht</a> of our activity on Hoodie's <a href="http://github.com/hoodiehq" target="_blank">GitHub</a> activity, — and of course our <a href="/blog">Blog</a> and our <a href="http://twitter.com/hoodiehq" target="_blank">Twitter</a> always offer the latest information as well.

        <p>
            Or maybe you want to host a <strong>Hoodie Workshop</strong>? Then we got something for you … We have prepared a document with prerequisites and a running order <a href="http://docs.hood.ie/en/community/hosting-a-hoodie-workshop.html" target="_blank">here</a>, it's still work in progress but also has links to tutorials or content you may want to use and some useful tips.
