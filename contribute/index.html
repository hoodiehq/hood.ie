            <strong>Hoodie wouldn’t be where it is today without the people</strong> who supported it by dedicating their time, skills, knowledge, by giving talks about it and supporting the project financially.
        </p>

            Here at Hoodie’s, there’s always a lot of work to do for everyone, for example for people who do programming, design, writing, organising and many more. <strong>We &#10084; the people who are involved in this project</strong>, and we’d love to have you on board.

        <h2 class="h5">Start a Meetup in your town</h2>

        <p>
            Hoodie is both easy-to-learn for beginners and a great tool for experienced developers. So why not start a Hoodie Meetup in your town? Many of us have been organising meetups for a long time now and found these three pieces really helpful:

Then we got something for you … We have prepared a document with prerequisites and a running order <a href="http://docs.hood.ie/en/community/hosting-a-hoodie-workshop.html" target="_blank">here</a>, it's still work in progress but also has links to tutorials or content you may want to use and some useful tips.

            Hoodie matters to us and we want it to have a good future and be a sustainable project. We also want to <strong>rethink the ways Open Source is built</strong> and funded, and we want to work towards <strong>a cultural change</strong>. Thus, we’re trying out <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2014/01/how-is-hoodie-funded/">different ways to fund it</a>. And you can support us:
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5">Wear Hoodie</h2>
        <p>
            Cozy, warm and snuggly: this is Hoodie. And this is what Hoodie textiles are like. You’ll find them all in our <a href="http://hoodiehq.spreadshirt.de" target="_blank">Hoodie-Merchandise-Shop</a>. We have some default items there, and some special offers which are only available for a limited time. By getting <strong>your own Hoodie</strong>-Shirt, Hoodie-Tote or whatever you may like, you also support us financially.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5">Sponsor Hoodie</h2>
        <p>
            We offer a <strong>sponsoring package for companies who are hiring new employees</strong> (or just want to sponsor us). Find more details on our <a href="/sponsoring">sponsoring page</a>.
