            <strong>Hoodie wouldn’t be where it is today without the people</strong> who supported it by dedicating their time, skills, knowledge, by giving talks about it and supporting the project financially.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here at Hoodie, there’s always a lot of work to do for everyone, for example for people who do programming, design, writing, organising and many more. <strong>We &#10084; the people who are involved in this project</strong>, and we’d love to have you on board.
        </p>
        <p>

            Hoodie is both easy-to-learn for beginners and a great tool for experienced developers. So why not start a Hoodie Meetup in your town? Many of us have been organising meetups for a long time now and found these three pieces really helpful:

            Hoodie matters to us, and we want it to have a good future and <a href="/blog/sustaining-hoodie.html">be a sustainable project</a>. Here are some ways you can help fuel the Hoodie movement:
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5">Become a Backer</h2>
        <p>
            Starting at only $1/month, you can join <a href="https://opencollective.com/hoodie">Hoodie’s OpenCollective</a>. Every contribution counts! And all expense are transparently documented.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5">Become an official Sponsor</h2>
        <p>
            Starting at only $100/month, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/hoodie#support">become an official Hoodie sponsor</a>. All sponsors are listed on our <a href="/sponsoring">sponsoring page</a>, and we will publically thank you for your support and are happy to share your message through our channels. If you rely on Hoodie or want to support our community, while benefiting getting your word out, this is for you!
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5">Wear Hoodie</h2>
        <p>
            Cozy, warm, and oh-so-snuggly: this is Hoodie &mdash; and this is what Hoodie textiles are like. You’ll find them all in our <a href="http://hoodiehq.spreadshirt.de" target="_blank">Hoodie merchandise shop</a>. You&rsquo;ll find an wide assortment of groovy Hoodie merch there, but don&rsquo;t be a snoozing &ldquo;loozer&rdquo;&mdash;some special offers are available for a limited time only!
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, investing in <strong>your own Hoodie</strong>-Shirt, Hoodie-Tote, or other Hoodie-Stuff will do more than keep you cozy . . . and it will do more than give you that warm feeling you get when you do something you know will make the world a little bit better . . . it will show the world you&rsquo;e played a part in making the world better. It will ensure you&rsquo;ll have even more Hoodie goodness in days to come.
