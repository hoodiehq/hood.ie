            <strong>Hoodies are great people, and Hoodies are also amazing textiles</strong>. This is why we now have an own <a href="http://hoodiehq.spreadshirt.de" target="_blank">shop</a> where you can get <strong>your very own Hoodie-textiles</strong>. In the shop, there are some default items, and some special offers which are only available for a limited time. By getting your own Hoodie-Shirt, Hoodie-Hoodie or whatever you may like, you also support us financially. <strong>All profits go directly into the work on the Open Source project</strong>.
