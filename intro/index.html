            Hoodie is a free and Open Source Software for building applications for the web and iOS. It is a complete backend for your apps, <strong>ready for you to get creative</strong>. It works immediately out-of-the-box: develop your frontend code, plug it into Hoodie’s <a href="/intro#get-started">frontend-friendly API</a> and your app is ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you develop it, your app runs locally first, you can then <a href="http://docs.hood.ie/en/deployment/linux.html" target="_blank">deploy and host it</a> wherever you want to. And if you want to extend Hoodie’s core features, you can check our list of <a href="http://plugins.hood.ie" target="_blank">currently available plugins</a> or <a href="http://docs.hood.ie/en/plugins/tutorial.html" target="_blank">build plugins</a> yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hoodie is a <a href="/initiatives#nobackend">noBackend</a> technology — it's there for making the lives of frontend developers easier by <strong>abstracting away the backend</strong> and keeping you from worrying about backends. It gives you <a href="/initiatives#dreamcode">Dreamcode</a>: a simple, easy-to-learn-and-implement frontend API built into it. Hoodie is also <a href="/initiatives#offline-first">Offline First</a>, which means that your app users’ data is stored locally by default so your Hoodie-based apps are accessible and usable anytime, independent from your users’ internet connection.
