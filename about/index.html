        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Hoodie is built by amazing <a href="/community">people</a> and is powered by strong core values.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason why Hoodie exists is that <a href="/community">everyone involved in this project</a> wants to <strong>help make the web a better place for everyone</strong>, and every one of us is convinced that <strong>web development should be accessible to as many people as possible</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hoodie is based on strong core principles and eventual goals which are embedded in everything we do in this project. We think that <strong>these values are inevitable</strong> when we want to ensure that the web and the way we develop it can have a future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like our software, our philosophy is work in progress, and we are still learning to apply it ourselves. Still, by working on these core principles, <strong>we want to contribute to making the web a better place</strong>, and we want Hoodie to be part of this future.

        <h1 class="h2">Empowerment</h1>
        <p>
            We believe that relevant parts of the future of the web will be determined by the question who is able to use the web and to build for the web. We think that <strong>technology should be accessible to people</strong>. Technology can make people’s lives easier when they know how to use it, when they’re able to build even small tools for solving problems they’re facing, and when it helps them automate recurring tasks. This is why it matters to us to <strong>make software development simpler and easier</strong> for a wide range of people and so <strong>enable them to solve their problems and realize their own ideas</strong>. We want to <strong>build technology that serves people and empowers them</strong>.

        <h1 class="h2">Diversity</h1>
        <p>
            We believe that <strong>the future of the web should be built by everyone</strong>, and that anything which is built on and for the web should involve and include a diverse group of people. We’re convinced that this is the only way to do it, because <strong>diversity matters</strong>. Diversity means for us to embrace and involve a wide variety of people into everything we do. This is also reflected in our <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Software development is an act of representation</strong>. We urgently need a wide range of ideas, customs, and wisdom to solve problems and build a future for the web. And we think that not only developers should work on the web — we think that we also need the skills of non-coding people like designers, writers, people with skills in organizing and many more to work on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also think that <strong>building the web is still mainly a question of privilege</strong> these days, and that the meritocratic structures of Open Source are highly problematic, and we’re trying all we can to <strong>find ways to do better</strong>.

        <h1 class="h2">Independence</h1>
        <p>
            At the moment, many parts of web technology are dominated by large companies. Although Open Source still has its stand there (just think of mail servers, operating systems, big data and many more that are powered by Open Source technology), we want to <strong>work on establishing a culture and structure of independent web technology</strong> to keep the idea of the web alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, everyone of us has their own dependencies: when we build the frontend of web applications, we have to rely on someone who builds the backend and someone who does the system administration. When we can’t code, we have to rely on others to develop the applications we need. When we’re on a train and our internet connection is down, all we can do is hope that our data is still accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We need technology that makes people independent</strong> in its best sense: technology that gives people the tools they need to be <strong>independent from others</strong>, from fast and <strong>stable internet connections</strong>, from <strong>large companies</strong> and <strong>centralised infrastructure</strong>, so they can do whatever they want to, wherever they want.

        <span>“We believe that when a technically-savvy elite of enthusiasts build tools and technologies for themselves, that technology will eventually trickle down and help less technically-savvy members of society. And, just like trickle-down economics, it doesn’t work.” <br>— Aral Balkan</span>

        <h1 class="h2">Decentralisation</h1>
        <p>
            Centralisation has been pushed forward extremely in the past decades, and we have to stop it. The <strong>technology we have today is still far too complicated</strong> for many people, and it’s still very far from being accessible. We need to <strong>make it easy, convincing and enjoyable</strong> to move our personal data and applications and tools we build away from big players. This means that decentralisation needs to be a fundamental part of the technology and platforms we build, so it can finally be chosen by people because it offers clear benefits for those who use it.
